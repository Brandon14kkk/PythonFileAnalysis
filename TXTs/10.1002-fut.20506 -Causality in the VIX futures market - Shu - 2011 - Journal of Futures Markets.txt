CAUSALITY IN THE VIX
FUTURES MARKET

This study examines the price-discovery function and information efficiency of a
fast growing volatility futures market: the Chicago Board of Option Exchange VIX
futures market. A linear Engle–Granger cointegration test with an error correction
mechanism (ECM) shows that during the full sample period, VIX futures prices
lead spot VIX index, which implies that the VIX futures market has some pricediscovery function. But a modified Baek and Brock nonlinear Granger test detects
bi-directional causality between VIX and VIX futures prices, suggesting that both
spot and futures prices react simultaneously to new information. Quarter-by-quarter
investigations show that, on average, the estimated parameters are not significantly different from zero, thus providing further evidence supporting information efficiency in the VIX futures market. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark

Causality in the VIX Futures Market

1. INTRODUCTION
The volatility implied by option prices is often considered a reflection of option
traders’ view of future market volatility of the underlying assets. It is often
believed that option traders are better informed; thus, the implied volatility
outperforms historical volatility in forecasting future realized volatility (see, e.g.
Christensen & Prabhala, 1998; Whaley, 2000). Partially motivated by the information role of option-implied volatilities, the Chicago Board of Option
Exchange (CBOE) began to publish an implied volatility index in 1993. This
volatility index, first known as VIX and renamed as VXO in 2003, was calculated from a series of at-the-money S&P 100 index options. In 2003, the CBOE
revised the VIX calculation method based on the S&P 500 index options prices.
VIX is a forward-looking volatility; it represents an option market estimate of
the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index for the next 30-day period. Since
its initiation, VIX has drawn growing attention from both academics and practitioners; it has gradually become a leading indicator of the U.S. stock market’s volatility. Corrado and Miller (2005) compare the forecast quality of implied volatility
indexes to historical volatility, and they find VIX outperforms historical volatility in forecasting future realized volatility. Similar result is found by Carr and
Wu (2006), who show that VIX outperforms GARCH volatility estimated from
the S&P 500 index returns. A very important feature of VIX is that VIX tends to
be higher when the stock market drops,1 for example, VIX was particularly high
during the last quarter of 2008, when the stock market tumbled. Whaley
(2009) explains why VIX is a useful “market fear gauge”: when stock market is
expected to fall, investors will purchase the S&P 500 put options for portfolio
insurance. The more investors demand, the higher the option prices. As option
price is a monotonic increasing function of volatility, VIX will increase when
the S&P 500 index option prices increase. According to a recent report by the
S&P 500 Corporation, VIX is very useful in forecasting the direction of future
market movements, particularly when movement is large. From December
2005 to December 2008, whenever the S&P 500 index dropped significantly
(i.e. more than 1% per day), there was a 96.72% possibility that the VIX would
increase and a 95% possibility that the VIX short-term futures index would
increase.2 These findings highlight the potential benefits of adding VIX as a
new asset class to hedge portfolio risks. Daigler and Rossi (2006) report
a significant diversification benefit from adding a long VIX position to an
S&P 500 portfolio. As spot VIX is not directly tradable, traders can long
VIX derivatives, such as VIX futures and VIX options. In March 2004, CBOE
1

It has long been documented that return volatility is negatively correlated with asset returns. This negative
correlation can be explained by the “leverage effect.” When a stock’s price goes down, its net value decreases. Consequently, the leverage as well as the risk increases.

began to launch its first volatility derivative product—namely, VIX futures,
which are cash-settled on the VIX index level. Encouraged by the success of
VIX futures, CBOE launched another volatility derivative product—S&P 500
three-month variance futures in May 2006. Currently, there are six kinds of
volatility futures and three kinds of volatility options traded on the CBOE.3
Brenner, Ou, and Zhang (2006) conclude that volatility derivatives markets
have great potential due to the huge demands for trading and for hedging
volatility risk. Since its initial trading in 2004, the open interest and trading
volume of VIX futures have grown rapidly. In 2004, the average open interest
and trading volume was 7,000 contracts and 460 contracts, respectively.
During the great market crash period of August 2008–November 2008, the
average daily trading volume was 4,800 contracts per day, and the average VIX
futures price was $19.20 during that period; hence, the average daily market
value was about $92 million dollars.4 The huge trading volume in the VIX
derivative market reflects the ever growing trend of using VIX products to
hedge portfolio risks. Szado (2009) compares the performance of a base portfolio (i.e. 60% equity plus 40% bond) to an alternative portfolio that uses long
VIX futures. His results show that from August to December 2008, adding a
10% VIX to the base portfolio cut return loss by 80% and reduced portfolio
standard deviation by one-third. The VIX futures market has now become one
of the most active futures markets on the CBOE, with an average daily open
interest of about 68,000 contracts.
Although VIX futures contracts have achieved widespread recognition,
pricing VIX futures remains very challenging. As VIX is forecast volatility, not a
traded asset, there is no cost of carry relationship between spot VIX and VIX
futures, such as that seen between the S&P 500 index and index futures.
Zhang and Zhu (2006) first model VIX futures by modeling instantaneous variance as a stochastic diffusion process. Zhu and Zhang (2007) and Zhang, Shu,
and Brenner (2010) each extends this model further. Other studies model variance
as a stochastic diffusion process with jump (Dupoyet et al. 2010; Lin, 2007).
Carr and Wu (2009) study the variance risk premiums of an individual stock
options market. Zhang and Huang (2010) develop models to price CBOE S&P
500 three-month variance futures.5
In contrast to the fruitful studies on theoretical models, only a few empirical studies use real VIX futures market data to examine the information
efficiency of this new market. Konstantinidi et al. (2008), and Konstantinidi
3

A detailed discussion can be found in Zhang and Huang (2009).
The VIX futures contract size is 1,000*price. In the period of August–November 2008, the average VIX futures
price was 19.2. Thus, we calculated approximate daily market value as 19.2*1,000*4,800 ⫽ 92,160,000.

VIX options have been studied by Sepp (2008a,b), Lin and Chang (2009, 2010), Wang and Daigler (2010),
and Cont and Kokholm (2010).

and Skiadopoulos (2011) use various forecasting methods and trading strategies to test the forecast ability of VIX futures price statistically and economically. They conclude that VIX futures prices are statistically predictable but
that the magnitude is too small to generate arbitrage profit, their results support the information efficiency of VIX futures market. However, their studies
focus on only one market—i.e. either the VIX or VIX futures market—and not
the temporal relationship between VIX and VIX futures.
In this study, we examine the lead–lag relationships between VIX and VIX
futures prices. The lead–lag relationships between spot and futures markets
reflect how quickly one market reacts to new information and to what degree
the two markets are linked. This issue has been extensively studied in various
financial markets as well as commodity markets. Generally, if a market is efficient, both spot prices and futures prices should react to new information
simultaneously, and there are no lead–lag relationships between one market
and the other. Some empirical studies find evidence that supports information
efficiency in spot and futures market. Wahab and Lashgari (1993) study the
S&P 500 index and the Financial Times index spot and futures prices, and
although they find futures prices weakly lead spot prices, the magnitude is too
small to generate any arbitrage profit. They conclude that their results are consistent with market efficiency. Pizzi et al. (1998) examine the lead–lag relationships between the S&P 500 cash index and its three-month and six-month
index futures, they find that cash index and index futures prices are cointegrated, bi-directional causations from futures prices to spot index and from spot
index to futures prices can be detected simultaneously. A recent study by Kung
and Carverhill (2005) on the U.S. Treasury STRIPS with different time to maturity shows that spot and futures prices are cointegrated and that no arbitrage
profit can be made after taking liquidity and transaction costs into consideration. However, some researchers believe that both futures markets and options
markets may contain more information than the spot market, because traders
in these markets are generally large traders and are better informed. Bohl et al.
(2011) find that causality between spot and futures market is strongly affected
by investor structure in these two markets: the market with more institutional
traders will lead the other market. As derivative markets are dominated by large
traders, futures prices may lead spot prices—or, it is said that futures markets
have a price-discovery function. Price-discovery functions are detected in a
number of commodity and financial markets (see, e.g. Brenner & Kronner,
1995; Chow, 2001; Stoll & Whaley, 1990). Given the mixed empirical findings,
the question naturally arises: what are the actual relationships between spot
VIX and VIX futures prices?
This study use linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests to examine the
dynamic relation between spot VIX and VIX futures prices over the relatively

long time period from April 2004 to May 2009. Volatility indexes have some
unique features that may affect the temporal relationships between VIX and
VIX futures prices. First, unlike other spot markets, the spot VIX itself is not
tradable. VIX is a forecast volatility derived from the S&P 500 index options,
and it is not an asset. It is also difficult to replicate VIX, because the underlying
basket of options is large and constantly rebalanced. Consequently, there is no
cost of carry relationship between spot VIX and VIX futures prices. Second,
volatility tends to follow a mean-reverting process, a higher current volatility is
accompanied by a lower future volatility. Spot VIX is a 30-day implied volatility,
so it is a forward-looking volatility for the next 30 days. A VIX futures price, on
the other hand, is a forward implied volatility, and it represents an expected
volatility for the 30-day period that follows the next 30 days. If the option market forecasts a volatility increase in the next 30-day period, the spot VIX will
increase. However, VIX futures prices will not increase to the same degree as
the spot VIX, because volatility tends to revert to its long-run mean. The stock
market often magnifies investor sentiments and overreacts in the short term.
Zhang et al. (2010) find that spot VIX is on average higher and more volatile
than VIX futures price. As VIX and VIX futures prices represent expected
volatilities for different time periods, and short-term expectations are often
revised in the subsequent period, the causal relation between VIX and VIX
futures prices may be weaker. Third, the correlations between VIX and VIX
future prices vary with the S&P 500 index returns. A recent study by the S&P
Corporation reveals that the correlations between spot VIX and the S&P 500
index returns as well as those between the VIX short-term Futures Index and
the S&P 500 index returns vary dramatically from ⫺0.2 to almost ⫺1.6 Thus, it
is necessary to examine the dynamic relationships between VIX and VIX
futures prices.
We first study causality using traditional linear Granger tests with an
error correction mechanism. To account for the time varying relationships
between VIX and VIX futures prices, we also conduct causality tests quarter
by quarter. Hiemstra and Jones (1994) point out the importance of adding
nonlinear Granger tests because traditional Granger tests fail to detect nonlinear causal relationships which are actually very common in reality.
Silvapulle and Moosa (1999) find a significant bi-directional causal relation
between the spot and future crude oil prices, which cannot be detected by
using linear Granger tests. In order to capture the nonlinear relationships
between VIX and VIX futures prices, we also conduct nonlinear Granger
tests. Market efficiency implies simultaneous reactions to news and a lack of
information spillover from one market to the other. However, as pointed out by

Causality in the VIX Futures Market

Bohl et al. (2011), causality between spot and futures markets is affected by
investors’ structure in these two markets, with the market that attracts more
institutional traders leading the other. In practice, both put options and VIX
futures are useful tools in hedging downside risks. If institutional investors
prefer to trade options, spot VIX calculated from option prices will lead VIX
futures prices. But if VIX futures markets attract better- informed traders,
VIX futures prices will lead VIX. For this reason, a causality test between VIX
and VIX futures price also serves as an indirect comparison of the relative
attractiveness of using the S&P 500 index options and VIX futures as hedging
tools. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address price-discovery function of the VIX futures market.7 The only related work to be found is that of
Konstantinidi et al. (2008), and Konstantinidi and Skiadopoulos (2011), who
show that both VIX and VIX futures are predictable by their historical patterns; however, such predictions fail to generate any arbitrage trading strategies. Their study favors information efficiency over price discovery in volatility
market. However, they do not study the inter-relationships between VIX and
VIX futures prices.
The rest part of the study is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a
descriptive study of VIX and VIX futures prices. Section 3 introduces the linear
Granger tests with an error correction mechanism and the nonlinear Granger
tests. Section 4 discusses empirical evidence, and Section 5 concludes.
2. VIX AND VIX FUTURES
Daily VIX levels, including open, high, low, and close levels, are available from
January 2, 1990. VIX futures data, including open, high, low, close, and settlement prices, as well as trading volume and open interest, are available from
March 26, 2004. All data can be downloaded from CBOE VIX micro site.8 Our
empirical study covers the period from March 26, 2004 to May 20, 2009.
Between March 26, 2004 and March 8, 2006, four futures contracts were
listed for each trading day. After that, the number of contracts listed on each
day increases. Now there are ten contracts traded on each day with different
maturity date. We construct four different VIX futures prices series, each with
rolling contracts. The nearest maturity contract contains futures prices of the
nearest maturity contract, and it always rolls to the next nearest maturity contract when the current contract is expired. The second nearest maturity
contract contains futures prices of the second maturity contract and always
7

During the process of revising our study, we noticed that Zhang, Sanning, and Shaffer (2010) also study the
market efficiency of the VIX futures market. They mainly focus on autocorrelation for a single time series;
however, we focus on lead–lag relation between two time series, i.e. spot VIX and VIX futures.

Figure 1 plots the spot VIX as well as the four rolling VIX futures prices

the same direction, but the basis varies over time. VIX is more volatile than VIX
futures, particularly between late 2008 and early 2009, while the S&P 500
index dropped sharply during that period. Table I reports the summary statistics of the VIX and VIX futures prices. The average VIX and VIX futures prices

these correlations vary significantly over time. The negative correlations are
stronger in large downside moves, indicating a possible use of VIX and VIX
futures prices as a “market fear gauge” (Whaley, 2009).

Although investors can trade VIX products to hedge stock market risks,
such hedge is not a perfect hedge as the S&P 500 index returns and VIX do not
perfectly negatively correlate. Table II shows how many times VIX and VIX
futures prices can be successfully used to hedge the S&P 500 index return
risks. It can be seen that both VIX and VIX futures prices moved in a direction
opposite to that of the S&P 500 index returns when the stock market was
volatile. For example, if the daily S&P 500 index goes up (down) by more than
3%, there is a 100% possibility of VIX and 97% possibility of near-term VIX
futures prices going down (up). However, for more than 75% of the trading
days, the S&P 500 index moved modestly (i.e. within a 1% range). When the
stock market is less volatile, the forecast ability of VIX and VIX futures prices
drops significantly. Thus, only 75 and 62% of the time, changes in VIX and VIX
futures prices, respectively, take a direction opposite that of the S&P 500 index
returns when the index drops within 1% per day. In such cases, if traders want
to use put options or VIX futures contracts to hedge their stock portfolio, there
are 25 and 38% chances that such a transaction will incur a loss. Table II also
reveals that the correlations between VIX and VIX futures prices are conditional on the S&P 500 index returns. VIX is higher than VIX futures prices when
the S&P 500 index returns jump by more than 3% per day in either direction.
The possibility of higher VIX is 88% for a downside movement and 78% for an
upside movement. However, if the S&P 500 index returns move modestly (i.e.
within a 1% range), there is a 72% possibility that VIX will be lower than VIX
futures prices. These results show that investors’ fear sentiments are magnified
in the short run, and participants in VIX futures market react less to great market jumps.

However, Equation (1) cannot be tested by ordinary least square regressions if
either St or Ft, or both series are nonstationary. Thus, the first step in timeseries analysis is to test whether a time series is stationary. The null hypothesis
of a single unit root is tested using the following two different models, one is
with a trend, the other is without a trend. The models are:

where i ⫽ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 stands for spot VIX, the nearest maturity VIX futures
prices, the second, the third, the fourth nearest maturity VIX futures prices,
respectively. Panel A in Table III reports the results of Augmented
Dickey–Fuller (ADF) unit root tests on spot VIX and four VIX futures prices
indexes. All t-statistics are below 5% critical values, so the null hypothesis of a
unit root fails to be rejected for any of the five indexes. This evidence implies
that the time series of VIX and VIX futures prices are nonstationary.
If a time series is nonstationary but its first difference is stationary, the
series is said to be integrated to order 1, and it is denoted as I(1). Panel B in
Table III reports the results of unit root tests on the first difference of the five
volatility indexes. The null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected at the 5% significance level for all volatility indexes, thereby providing strong evidence of no
unit root in the first differences of each time series. It is therefore concluded
that all the five volatility indexes are I(1) processes.
Engle and Granger (1987) show that for two I(1) processes, if their linear combination is stationary (I(0)), the two time series are cointegrated.
Economically speaking, two variables are cointegrated if they have a long-term,
or equilibrium relationship between them. One approach to testing for cointegration is to construct test statistics from the residuals of a cointegrating
regression. Let ␧t denote the estimated residuals from Equation (1), a test for

Significant negative test statistics suggest rejection of the unit root hypothesis
and evidence for cointegration. Table IV reports the Engle–Granger cointegration results for different pairs of volatility time series. VIX is cointegrated with
four VIX futures rolling contracts at the 5% significance level. Among the four
VIX futures contracts, the nearest maturity contract is cointegrated with the
three other contracts at the 5% significance level. But the fourth nearest maturity contract is not cointegrated with the second nearest maturity contract, and
is only weekly cointegrated (at 10% significance level) with the third nearest
maturity contract. This result indicates that the second nearest maturity contract is not a simple linear combination of the first and third even though it
stands in between. As spot VIX and VIX futures prices are cointegrated, there is
a long-term, or equilibrium relationship between the two. But in the short run,
there may be disequilibrium.

Engle and Granger (1987) state that if two variables Y and X are cointegrated, then each series can be represented by an error correction mechanism
(ECM) which includes both the last period’s equilibrium error and the lagged
values of the first difference of each variable. Following Wahab and Lashgari
(1993), the following regressions with error correction mechanism are adopted.9
Let Fi,t denote the ith futures contract where i starts from 1 to 4 representing the first nearest maturity contract to the fourth nearest maturity contract. Let St denote the spot VIX at time t, the ECM can be written as follows:
¢Fi.t ⫽ df ⫹ af ûi,t⫺1 ⫹ bf ¢St⫺1 ⫹ gf ¢Fi,t⫺1 ⫹ ef,t,
¢St ⫽ ds ⫹ asûi,t⫺1 ⫹ bs ¢Ft⫺1 ⫹ gs ¢St⫺1 ⫹ es,t,

(4)

where ⌬ denotes the first difference operator, and ûi,t ⫽ Fi,t ⫺ a0 ⫺ a1St
denotes the error from the linear regression between Fi,t and St. The two random error terms are denoted by ␧f,t and ␧s,t. Equation (4) is jointly tested by
seemingly unrelated regressions. The error correction mechanism is represented by the coefficients of a, which measure how quickly current prices correct
last period deviation and restore to their long- term equilibrium. If af is significant, then current VIX futures price will adjust to last period deviation from
equilibrium. Suppose ûi,t⫺1 is positive, which means Fi,t⫺1 is too high (above its
equilibrium level a0 ⫹ a1St⫺1), as a is expected to be negative, the term af ûi,t⫺1

Wahab and Lashgari (1993) studied the relation between the S&P 500 index futures and the index with an
ECM and found no clear lead–lag relationship between them.

is also negative. Therefore, ⌬Fi,t will be negative to restore the equilibrium.
That is, if Ft⫺1 is above its equilibrium, it will start falling in the next period to
correct the equilibrium error. By the same token, if last period futures price is
below its long-term equilibrium, it will start to increase in the next period to
restore the equilibrium. Market efficiency implies that both the spot prices and
the futures prices react to information simultaneously, there is no adjustment
in the next period, so a will be insignificant. The lead–lag relationships are represented by the coefficients of b. If bs is significant but bf is insignificant, it is
said that there is a unidirectional causality from futures prices to spot prices. In
such a case, the futures market leads spot market in reflecting new information. An inverse causality can be found if bs is insignificant but bf is significant.
If both coefficients are jointly insignificant, then there is no Granger causality
between futures and spot prices. Hence, the use of cointegration analysis and
error correction mechanism enables one to test price discovery over market
efficiency directly.
3.2. Nonlinear Granger Causality Testing
One important problem with the linear causality tests is that such tests may
ignore the nonlinear relations between economic variables, which are actually
very common in real world. Baek and Brock (1992) propose a nonparametric
method to test nonlinear causal relations. Hiemstra and Jones (1994) use a
modified Baek and Brock test to examine the causal relations between stock
price and trading volume; they find while linear tests detect unidirectional
causality from stock returns to trading volume, nonlinear tests provide an additional evidence that causality also exists from trading volume to stock returns.
Similar results are found by Silvapulle and Moosa (1999), who study nonlinear
causal relations between crude oil spot and futures prices. In this study, we follow the modified nonlinear test by Hiemstra and Jones (1994).
Let {xt} and {yt} be two strictly stationary and weakly dependent time
series, denote the m-length lead vector of xt by xm
t and the lx-length and
ly-length lag vector of {xt} and {yt}, respectively, by xlxt⫺lx and ylxt⫺lx. For lx ⱖ 1,
ly ⱖ 1, m ⱖ 1 and e ⬎ 0, y does not strictly Granger cause x if:

where Pr(⭈) and ||⭈|| denote the probability and the maximum norm, respectively. The left side of Equation (5) is the conditional probability that two arbitrary
m-length lead vector of {xt} are within a distance e of each other, given that
the corresponding lx-length and ly-length lag vector are within e of each other.

The right side of Equation (5) is the conditional probability that two arbitrary
m-length lead vector of {xt} are within a distance e of each other, given that the
corresponding lx-length lag vector are within e of each other. Equation (5) simply states that if y does not strictly Granger cause x, then adding lagged values
of y will not improve prediction power of x from lagged x values. The conditional probabilities in Equation (5) can be expressed as the ratios of joint probabilities, these joint probabilities are defined as follows:
m⫹lx

The strict Granger noncausality condition in Equation (5) can be expressed as
follows:

The nonlinear Granger causality tests are applied to the estimated residual
series from the seemingly uncorrelated vector model in Equation (4), {␧f,t},
{␧s,t}. Baek and Brock (1992) argue that by removing linear predictive power
with a linear vector model, any remaining incremental predictive power of one
residual series for another can be considered nonlinear predictive power. To
conduct the modified Baek and Brock test, values for the lead length m, the lag
lengths lx and ly, and the scale parameter e must be chosen. Following
Hiemstra and Jones (1994), we set the lead length at m ⫽ 1, and set lx ⫽ ly,
using lag lengths of 1 to 4 lags. To eliminate the scale problems, each series is
standardized using a common standard deviation of s ⫽ 1, and e is set to be
1.5, 1 and 0.5 respectively.

4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
4.1. Linear Granger Test Results
Equation (4) is estimated to test the causality between spot VIX and VIX
futures prices using seemingly unrelated regressions, the results are reported in
Table V. Panel A reports the results of the Granger tests on VIX and the nearest
maturity VIX futures prices. The null hypothesis that VIX levels do not lead VIX
futures prices cannot be rejected as b1, f is insignificant at the 5% level, thus
indicating that historical changes in VIX provide little information in forecasting the next period’s VIX futures price. On the other hand, bs is significant at
the 5% level, and so the null hypothesis that VIX futures prices do not lead VIX
can be rejected, indicating that the VIX futures prices contain useful information in forecasting next period VIX. This unidirectional causality is also true for
the second nearest maturity VIX futures prices, but is weaker for futures prices
with longer maturities. The error correction coefficient af is negative and significant at the 5% level. The negative af implies that if the current futures price
is above its equilibrium level, it will decrease in value in the next period, thus
eliminating any disequilibrium. as is also significant and has a positive sign.
Since we adopt futures equilibrium errors as the error correction term
(ûi,t ⫽ Fi,t ⫺ a0 ⫺ a1St ) , a positive as shows that if ûi,t is positive (which means
current futures price is too high relative to its equilibrium price), the spot price
in the next period will increase. Our results show that even in the absent of
cost of carry relation, there is a long run equilibrium between VIX spot and
futures prices. Both the VIX and VIX futures prices respond to the deviations
from equilibrium, though the speed of adjustment is quicker for the VIX
futures prices. This result also suggests that the volatility market does not
process information simultaneously, and there is at least one-day delay in
absorbing new information. The autocorrelation coefficient gf is significant at

the 5% significance level for the nearest and the second nearest maturity contract, indicating that VIX futures prices can be forecasted by their historical
levels. Our results confirm the finding of Konstantinidi and Skiadopoulos
(2011) that historical VIX prices are useful in forecasting the next period’s VIX
futures prices. Collectively, the results in Table V suggest that the VIX futures
prices lead VIX, the pattern is almost similar for the second nearest maturity
VIX futures contract. The full sample results support price discovery vs. market
efficiency in the VIX futures market. If this is true, it implies that traders can
use VIX futures prices to forecast VIX. VIX is a forward-looking volatility of the
S&P 500 index returns and is negatively correlated with the S&P 500 index. If
VIX can be predicted by previous VIX futures price, market agents may look at

price changes in the VIX futures market when making their best guess of VIX,
and adjust their stock market positions accordingly. For a distant VIX futures
price, the causality coefficient b is not significant but the error correction coefficient af is still significant. These findings are in accordance with those of previous studies. Pizzi et al. (1998) find that the S&P 500 index futures returns
significantly lead cash index returns. Bohl et al. (2011) find that causality
between spot and futures market is affected by the investor structure, with
information spilling over from the market that is dominated by institutional
investors into the other market. Our findings provide indirect evidence that
traders in the VIX futures market are better informed than traders in the S&P
500 index option markets.
4.2. Nonlinear Granger Test Results
Table VI reports the nonlinear Granger causality tests applied to the residuals
{␧f,t} and {␧s,t} of the seemingly unrelated regressions, corresponding to VIX
futures prices and VIX in Equation (4). For all cases, we set the lead length at
m ⫽ 1, and lx ⫽ ly, using the lag lengths of 1 to 4. Following Hiemstra and Jones
(1994), we apply the test to standardized residuals to remove any linear relationships. We set the scale parameter at e ⫽ 1s where s ⫽ 1 denotes the standard
deviation of the standardized residuals.10 There is strong evidence of bidirectional causality between VIX and VIX futures prices of all maturities, as all
test statistics TVAL are significant at 1% level. This result contrasts sharply to
that of the linear Granger test, where only unidirectional causality from VIX
futures prices of the nearest and the second nearest maturity contracts to
VIX can be detected. Adding nonlinear effects into consideration significantly
enhances the causal relationships between two time series. Hiemstra and Jones
(1994) examine causality between stock returns and trading volume and they
find bi-directional causality relationships which can not be detected by the linear Granger test; Silvapulle and Moosa (1999) find bi-directional causality
between the crude oil spot and futures prices by the nonlinear test, while the
linear test suggests one-way causality from the futures prices to the spot prices.
However, it seems that nonlinear tests detect causality too often. Logically, we
would expect that distant prices contain less information, so that the causal relationship decays with time. However, in Hiemstra and Jones (1994)’s work, stock
returns (trading volumes) 8 days ago or yesterday have almost the same impact
on today’s trading volumes(stock returns). In Silvapulle and Moosa (1999)’s
study, causality between the spot and futures prices lasts even after 12 days. We
find that the distant VIX futures prices have almost the same forecast ability as
10

We also set e ⫽ 0.5 and e ⫽ 1.5 and there are no significant differences.

the near term VIX futures prices, which shades a doubt on the result of the
nonlinear Granger test. Moreover, Hiemstra and Jones (1994) point out that
the nonlinear test fail to reveal the sign of the causal relationship, thereby
adding more complexities in explaining the nonlinear results. Anyway, our
results show that over the full sample period, VIX futures prices lead spot VIX
for at least 1 day, though the nonlinear Granger tests detect even stronger bidirectional causality.

Causality in the VIX Futures Market

S&P 500 index level. When the S&P 500 index moves greatly, VIX is higher than
VIX futures price; when the S&P 500 index moves modestly, VIX is lower
than VIX futures price. If the temporal relations between VIX and VIX futures
prices are unstable, statistical reference based on a constant coefficient
assumption, using the full sample in estimation, can be misleading. To account
for the fact that the parameters may not be constant over time and to further
check the validity of the lead–lag relationship between VIX futures prices and
VIX, Equation (4) is re-estimated on quarterly basis. The whole of the sample
period comprises 20 complete quarters. Table VII reports estimated parameters
quarter by quarter, and the estimated parameters are quite noisy. Among all 20
quarters, the VIX futures prices lead VIX in only two of them (i.e. Q1 of 2008
and Q3 of 2008)—in another quarter (i.e. Q1 of 2005) spot VIX is found to
lead the VIX futures price. Bidirectional causation between spot VIX and VIX
futures prices is detected in one quarter (Q2 of 2006). Except for these four
quarters, there is no clear lead–lag relationship from either VIX to VIX futures
prices or from VIX futures prices to VIX. The null hypothesis that the average
estimated causality parameters (the b coefficients) fails to be rejected even at
the 10% significance level. This evidence is far from overwhelming, and the
mixed nature of the directional impacts makes any systematic impact unlikely.
Because there is no clear lead–lag relationship from VIX futures prices to VIX,
it is conclude that VIX futures prices do not serve a consistent price-discovery
function. This result contrasts with the full sample estimation result, where
VIX futures prices lead VIX on at least one day. The error correction coefficients (i.e. the a coefficients) become insignificant in most quarters, indicating
that both VIX futures prices and VIX reflect information in the same period—
further evidence that supports information efficiency versus price discovery.
Konstantinidi et al. (2008), and Konstantinidi and Skiadopoulos (2011) find
that although VIX future prices are predictable, such forecast cannot generate
any arbitrage profits, they conclude that the VIX futures market is information
efficient. Our results show although over the full sample period, VIX can be
forecasted by VIX futures price, such prediction is unstable and is not very useful in gauging future movement in either VIX or VIX futures.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The goal of this research is to explicitly examine causality between VIX and VIX
futures prices. In light of the information role of implied volatility in forecasting
the S&P 500 index return volatilities, and the growing interest in trading VIX
derivatives for portfolio diversification purposes, it is important to directly
address the issue of whether VIX and VIX futures price are predictable by one
another, and whether they can be predicted by their own historical patterns.

In this study, we use Engle–Granger cointegration tests with the ECM to investigate the lead–lag dynamics between VIX and VIX futures prices. The empirical
results suggest two primary findings. First, over the full sample period, the nearest and the second nearest maturity VIX futures prices lead the spot VIX index,
indicating that the VIX futures market has some price-discovery function. No
causality effect is detected for distant VIX futures prices. Historical VIX futures
prices are useful in forecasting the next period’s VIX futures price. Collectively,
these results suggest that the VIX futures market contain more information than
VIX. One possible explanation for this is that VIX futures market maybe more
attractive to institutional traders. Empirical evidence shows that VIX values are
much higher than VIX futures prices, particularly when the stock market is
volatile. This may implies that portfolio insurance through long S&P 500
options may be too expensive when investors are dominated by fear sentiments.
The relative stable VIX futures prices combined with high liquidity makes VIX
futures market very attractive. If more informed traders are attracted by the
VIX futures market, it is reasonable that VIX futures prices lead spot VIX.
Second, the unidirectional causality from VIX futures prices to VIX is unstable,
subject to the estimation method and the sampling period. A modified Baek and
Brock nonlinear Granger detect bi-directional causality between VIX and VIX
futures prices, suggesting that both spot and futures prices react simultaneously to new information. Quarter-by-quarter estimations show that the estimated
causality coefficients are inconstant, and on average do not significantly different from zero, thus providing further evidence that VIX and VIX futures mraket
react to information in the same period. Though the VIX futures market has
some price-discovery function, such prediction power is unstable and is not very
useful in gauging future price movement. Overall, it is concluded that the VIX
futures market is information efficient.
