Adverse Selection and Competitive
Market Making: Empirical Evidence
from a Limit Order Market
Patrik Sandås
University of Pennsylvania

This article presents a new methodology for testing economic restrictions on the price
schedules offered in a limit order book that are based on (i) break-even conditions for
marginal limit orders and (ii) rational updating conditions for order book revisions over
time. Using order flow data from the Stockholm Stock Exchange, I find strong evidence of insufficient depth in the limit order books relative to the theoretical predictions.
An extended model, which allows the model parameters to depend on market conditions,
captures some of the systematic variation in the observed order book depth.

During the last 15 years many securities markets have introduced electronic
limit order book systems.1 This development has spurred a growing interest in the theoretical and empirical properties of such markets.2 In order to
account for the popularity of this trading institution, we are interested in
understanding traders’ order placement decisions and their contribution to
liquidity and price formation. This article takes a step toward that goal by
showing how the restrictions that the order books must satisfy in a relatively
frictionless setting can be empirically tested. In particular, it is shown that
the order books satisfy both a set of static break-even conditions and a set
of dynamic updating conditions. An empirical strategy is formulated based
on these conditions and implemented on order flow data from the Stockholm
Stock Exchange.
In limit order markets the liquidity at any point in time is characterized
by the limit order book. A limit order specifies a fixed order price and quantity and is not assured execution. When a limit order is submitted it enters

the centralized order book, where it is stored until it is executed or canceled. A trade occurs when a market order arrives and is executed against
the outstanding limit orders. In the book, limit orders are prioritized first by
price and then by submission time. In most limit order markets there are
no designated market makers and therefore all liquidity is provided by limit
orders.
The model used in this article is a version of Glosten (1994) with discrete
prices and a time priority rule as in Seppi (1997).3 In this single-period
model, limit orders are first submitted by profit-maximizing market makers.
A trader then arrives and submits a market order. It is assumed that the market
orders may be submitted by a privately informed trader and that a larger
market order implies a greater change in the expected value of the asset.
The expected profit for a market maker submitting a limit order depends
on the probability of execution and the value of the asset conditional on
the order being executed. Since limit orders are executed in succession, the
execution probability for a limit sell order is decreasing in its price, and at a
given price it is decreasing in the submission time of the order. The resulting
price schedule is then, in general, increasing or decreasing for market buy or
sell orders, respectively. Each marginal bid and offer that defines this price
schedule is characterized by a break-even condition.
By combining the break-even conditions with moment conditions that
characterize the distribution of market orders it is possible to identify the
underlying adverse selection costs. The adverse selection cost in this setting
measures how much the expected value of the asset is revised in response to
a given market order quantity. In other words, the adverse selection cost is
represented by a “price impact function,” which depends on the trade size.
A second building block for the empirical analysis is a set of updating restrictions that link the market order flow to the order book dynamics. If updating
is rational, the change in the value predicted by the price impact function
should on average be correct. By combining these updating restrictions with
the break-even conditions, I obtain a set of internally consistent restrictions
on both the “shape” of the limit order book at a point in time and on the
order book revisions in response to trades.
The main empirical findings of the article are as follows:
1. The price schedules offered by the order books appear to be too
steep, that is, they offer insufficient depth relative to the theoretical
predictions.
2. For most stocks the market order flow distribution strongly depends on
state variables such as the past trading volume. I also find evidence

Rock (1996) use a similar setup for the order book in a model of the interaction between the specialist and the
limit order book at the NYSE. Biais, Martimort, and Rochet (2000) analyze liquidity provision by competing
market makers and obtain bid (ask) prices equal to “upper (lower) tail” expectations as in Glosten (1994) in
the limit as the number of market makers goes to infinity.

consistent with more (less) severe adverse selection risk in markets
with high (low) stock-specific or market-wide volatility and low (high)
trading volume, holding everything else constant. A restricted model
that does not allow for any state dependence is strongly rejected for
all stocks. However, even with the state variables, stock-specific and
market-wide volatility and trading volume, a test of overidentifying
restrictions rejects for 5 of the 10 sample stocks at the 1% level.
3. The deviations from the model predictions are inversely correlated
with the time elapsed since the last transaction. These findings suggest
that the order book may adjust with a delay to new information.
This article contributes to the literature on limit order markets. Biais,
Hillion, and Spatt (1995) study the order flow dynamics at the Paris Bourse
and find evidence consistent with information asymmetries and competition.
This article builds on their article by directly testing theoretical predictions
about the order books and the order flow. De Jong, Nijman, and Röell (1996)
test a version of Glosten (1994). This article extends their analysis by providing a direct test of the model restrictions, incorporating the effects of price
discreteness and the time priority rule and utilizing both order book and order
flow information.4
The article is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a brief description
of the market institution and the dataset. The theoretical model is presented in
Section 2. Section 3 develops the empirical methodology. Section 4 presents
the empirical results. Extensions are discussed in Section 5. Concluding comments are in Section 6.
1. Description of the Market and the Dataset
1.1 The market institution
In 1990 the Stockholm Stock Exchange introduced a computerized limit
order market. This trading system is similar to those systems used on the
Toronto Stock Exchange and the Paris Bourse. In this mechanism, limit
orders are stored in a centralized order book and automatically crossed with
market orders, giving priority according to price and time. Investors submitting limit orders have the option to “hide” part of the limit order quantity—
that is, to allow only a part of the limit order quantity to be displayed in
the book. The hidden part of any limit order has lower priority than all the
visible order quantities at a given price level. The data used in this article do
not distinguish between hidden and visible order quantities.

Other empirical studies of limit order books with/without a specialist include Coppejans and Domowitz (1998),
Hamao and Hasbrouck (1995), Hedvall, Niemeyer, and Rosenqvist (1997), Kavajecz (1999), and Lehmann
and Modest (1994). Handa and Schwartz (1996), Harris and Hasbrouck (1996), and Lo, MacKinlay, and
Zhang (1999) analyze order submission strategies.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 14 n 3 2001

The limit order market is transparent; information about the five best bids
and offers with corresponding quantities is instantaneously transmitted to the
computer screens in the offices of the exchange members. The transparency
and rich information disseminated to all market participants facilitate detection of profit opportunities. The computerized trading system allows market
participants to quickly shift their market-making activities from one stock
to another. The above-mentioned features of the institution suggest that it is
reasonable to consider a model where the order book is determined by value
traders, who do not need to trade but submit orders to take advantage of
profit opportunities in the market.
1.2 The dataset
The dataset contains histories for all trades and orders that were submitted
to the electronic trading system for a sample of 10 actively traded stocks at
the Stockholm Stock Exchange.5 The sample period consists of 59 trading
days between December 3, 1991, and March 2, 1992. The sample is representative of the electronic trading but it does not cover all trading in these
stocks. Transactions made on London’s SEAQ International and on NASDAQ
accounted for a significant fraction of the turnover in some companies during this period. In addition, block trades can be settled outside the electronic
system. While other trading venues account for a significant proportion of
the volume, most transactions are routed to the electronic trading system.
The analysis in this article focuses on electronic trading.
Descriptive statistics for the sample stocks are reported in Table 1. Henceforth I will refer to the sample stocks by their respective symbols listed in
the first column of Table 1. The total number of transactions over the sample
period, reported in the second column, ranges from a low of 667 (PROC) to
a high of 8102 (LME). In the third column, similar differences in activity
are observed in the total number of limit orders submitted, where the low
is 1463 (PROC) and the high is 12,646 (LME). The fourth column reports
the average transaction price for the stocks. During this period US $1 was
equal to roughly 6.5 Swedish Crowns. Most of the stocks in the sample are
traded with a tick size of one Crown (prices greater than 100 Crowns), corresponding to a tick size of 15 cents for a $15 stock. The exception is SEB,
and for part of the sample LME and INVE, which traded in the 0.5 Crown
tick size range (prices less than 100 Crowns). The daily trading volume for
the stocks in the sample is quite variable, with a minimum of 1.1 million
Crowns (PROC) and a maximum of 35.2 million Crowns (LME). The last
column reports the sample period returns.
5

The full sample included all companies in the OMX index during the sample period. OMX is a market index
that includes the 30 most actively traded securities on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The index is updated
semiannually. A smaller subsample of 10 companies was randomly selected among the stocks with at least
500 trades during the 59-day sample period.

The table reports descriptive statistics for the sample. The sample period is December 3, 1991, to March 2, 1992. Transaction
prices are measured in Swedish Crowns and the trading volume is measured in million Swedish Crowns. During the sample
period US $1 was roughly equivalent to 6.5 Swedish Crowns. The sample period return is computed using the first and the last
transaction price for each stock.

Summary statistics for the limit order books. The mean and standard deviation (first and second row for each stock, respectively)
of the difference between the second-best and the best ask price, the best ask and best bid price, and the best and second-best
bid price for each stock are reported in the first three columns. The mean and standard deviation for the quantities offered in
the limit order book for the two best ask and two best bid price levels are reported in the last four columns for each stock. The
quantities at the second-best price levels are cumulative, that is, they include the quantities at the respective best price level (bid
or ask). The spreads are measured in Swedish Crowns and the quantities in 100 shares.

In Table 2 the average order book spreads and the cumulative order quantities are reported for the two best bid and ask levels in the book.6 Notice that
for some stocks, for example, SEB, the average spreads are very close to 0.5
Crown, which is the minimum tick size for that stock. For other stocks, for
example, ASEA, PROC, and STOR, spreads of several Crowns are common.
The total order quantities offered at the best and second-best price levels are
between 1.8 and 2.4 times the quantities offered at the best price levels. For
all stocks, the spreads between the best and the second-best quotes on either
the bid or the offer side are greater than the bid-ask spreads.
Table 3 reports the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentiles for the
market buy and sell order quantities (numbers of shares), as well as the average market order size for each stock. Market orders submitted in a sequence
within 30 seconds by the same broker-dealer on the same side of the market
(e.g., a market buy order by dealer A directly followed by another market buy order from dealer A within 30 seconds) were aggregated into one
market order observation. Note that for all of the stocks the median market
order size is smaller than the average market order size, and for most, much
smaller.
Table 2 documents that the spread is weakly increasing in the trade size for
all stocks. One explanation for this is that larger orders are more likely to be
submitted by informed traders. A standard method for decomposing the bidask spread into an adverse selection component (which may depend on the

In the data it is rare to observe orders that “walk up the book” beyond the two best price levels. In other
words, orders beyond the two best price levels are unlikely to be executed by the next market order.

The table reports estimation results for the following price impact regression:
pt+1 − pt = a + b(It+1 − It ) + cqt+1 It+1 + t+1 ,
where It is a trade indicator, qt+1 is the order quantity (100 shares), pt is the marginal price of the time t transaction, and t+1
is an update of the expected fundamental value that is orthogonal to the time t market order. The corresponding t-statistics are
reported directly below each parameter estimate. R 2 values are reported in the last row.

trade size) and an order processing component is to estimate a “price impact
regression” [see Glosten and Harris (1988)]. This methodology is designed
for a different institutional setting and therefore the estimates presented below
are best interpreted as benchmarks for the subsequent analysis. However, the
empirical strategy presented in this article is related to this method and the
key differences are briefly discussed below.
Denote the fixed order processing cost by b and the variable adverse selection cost by c. The expected change in the fundamental value conditional on
the order submitted at time t, or its “price impact,” is cqt It , where It is an
indicator that takes value +1 and −1 for market buy and sell orders, respectively. The market order quantity qt is measured in 100 shares. A transaction
price for a time t market order of pt = Xt + bIt + cqt It , where Xt denotes
the fundamental value at time t, covers both the order processing and the
adverse selection costs. Differencing pt+1 and pt yields
pt+1 − pt = a + b(It+1 − It ) + cqt+1 It+1 + εt+1 ,

where a is the expected change in value and εt+1 is an update of the expected
fundamental value that is orthogonal to the time t market order. The results
for this price impact regression are reported in Table 4.7 For each stock, the
parameter estimates and the corresponding t-values are reported in the first
six rows, followed by the R 2 values. The fixed order processing cost, b, and
the adverse selection cost, c, are both positive and statistically significant at
the 1% level for all of the stocks.

as an implied price schedule based on the above regression results for two

The time-series mean (dashed line) and median (dash-dot line) of the markup or discount (measured in
Swedish Crowns on the vertical axis) that a trader submitting hypothetical market orders of different sizes
(measured in roundlots [100 shares] on the horizontal axis) would have paid or received relative to the midquote are plotted for two stocks, ASEA and ASTR. The markups and discounts are computed for the marginal
unit of each market order size as follows. For each limit order book observed before a transaction, the markup
(discount) that market orders of various sizes would pay or receive, respectively, are computed. The market
order sizes are chosen to match the order flow by percentiles reported in Table 3. The solid line in each

order book. These initial findings suggest that there is not enough depth in
the order book or, in other words, the order books appear to offer profit
opportunities. It is, however, premature to draw this conclusion at this point.
In this trading institution a trader cannot, as I did in Equation (1), condition
on the size of the market order that will trigger the execution of her limit
order. This implies that the execution of a limit order can result in a gain
or a loss and that an order only breaks even on average [see Rock (1996)
and Glosten (1994)]. Thus the transaction price is not, in general, equal
to the conditional expectation of the fundamental value (plus or minus the
fixed order processing cost) as in Equation (1). In addition, discrete prices
combined with the time priority rule allows for nonmarginal limit orders to
earn positive profits in the order book. These properties are accounted for in
the empirical strategy presented in Section 3.
In the next section, I present a model of the liquidity provision in a limit
order market. The model captures important institutional features of this market, including the transparency of the trading system, price discreteness, and
the time priority rule. The model imposes testable restrictions on the data that
allow us to examine whether or not the discrepancies between the empirical
price schedules and the implied price schedules presented above imply that
there are unexploited profit opportunities in the market.
2. Model
The model presented here follows Glosten (1994), but it is modified to
include discrete prices and a time priority rule as in the limit order market
version of Seppi (1997). The theoretical results are reviewed here to provide
a framework for the empirical analysis.
2.1 General features of the model
There are two types of agents in the market: market makers and traders.
Patient market participants, who supply liquidity by submitting limit orders,
are referred to as market makers. Traders, who may have private information,
demand liquidity by submitting market orders. Consequently they can be
thought of as impatient market participants who do not want to postpone
their trading. There are a large number of both types of agents. The market
makers are risk neutral and profit maximizing.
The agents trade a risk-free asset with a return normalized to zero and
a risky security whose value in period t is given by Xt . This is the fundamental value of the security conditional on all publicly available information.
This value changes as new information arrives. The next period’s fundamental
713

The Review of Financial Studies / v 14 n 3 2001

value, Xt+1 , is given by
Xt+1 = Xt + µ + dt+1 ,

(2)

where dt+1 represents a random innovation in the value and µ is the expected
change.
Trading occurs sequentially over periods indexed by t. In each period t,
there are three stages. Shortly before time t, market makers are randomly
given the opportunity to submit new limit orders. This process is repeated as
long as someone wishes to place a new order. At time t, when the new limit
order book has been established, a trader arrives and submits a market order.
After the trade, the new fundamental value is announced and the process
starts over.
The agents trade by submitting market and limit orders to a limit order
book. For any order book I will use the following notation for the order
prices and quantities. Let the prices {p+1 , p+2 , . . . , p+k } denote the ask
prices in the book ordered from the best ask price, p+1 , to the kth best
ask price, p+k . The order quantities associated with each price level are
denoted by {Q+1 , Q+2 , . . . , Q+k }. The bid side variables are denoted analogously with a negative index. The market order quantity submitted at time t is
denoted by mt . Market buy orders correspond to positive quantities, m > 0,
and market sell orders to negative quantities, m < 0.
2.2 The liquidity demand
The trader arriving in a given period is independently drawn from a population of traders. In principle, the optimal market order quantity submitted
by the trader will depend on factors such as the trader’s current position in
the security and her information about the likely future value of the security.
In order to simplify the analysis and concentrate on the decision problem
of the market makers I use a reduced form representation for the trader’s
demand for liquidity. I assume that a trader will be a buyer or a seller with
equal probability and that the desired market order quantity is exponentially
distributed with expected market order quantities λ and φ, respectively, for
buyers and sellers. The distribution of market order quantities m can then be
summarized by the following density function f (m), where

1 −m
e λ if m > 0 (market buy),
fmb (m) = 2λ
(3)
f (m) =
1 m
fms (m) = 2φ e φ
if m < 0 (market sell).
I can now solve the market-makers’ decision problem using this
parameterization.
2.3 The market-makers’ decision problem and the order book
The traders who demand liquidity may be informed about the innovation
in the value of the security, dt+1 . The market order is therefore informative
714

Adverse Selection and Competitive Market Making

about the likely value of this innovation. An alternative explanation, which in
this case will lead to the same limit order books, is that some traders observe
public information regarding the value of the innovation and “pick off” limit
orders that are exposed. In both cases the market order quantity submitted is
correlated with the value of the security in the next period. The information
link between the market order quantity m and the fundamental value Xt
can be represented by a nondecreasing price impact function, h(m), which
relates the market order quantity m to the next period’s fundamental value
as follows:
E[Xt+1 |Xt , m] = Xt + µ + h(m),

(4)

where µ is the expected change in the fundamental value. The subsequent
analysis is based on a symmetric linear specification for h(·) given by
h(m) = αm,

(5)

where α is the per unit price impact of market orders. If market buy (sell)
orders tend to signal increases (decreases) in the value of the asset, α is
expected to be positive. For a given distribution of market orders, a larger α
parameter implies a more severe adverse selection problem.8
Consider an arbitrary order book and an arbitrary price level p. A limit
order, which is the Qth best sell order unit in the limit order book, is executed
whenever a market order that is sufficiently large arrives, that is, mt ≥ Q.
Multiple limit orders at the same price level do not “split the surplus.”
Instead, limit orders are executed according to strict time priority. This means
that all limit order units with a higher time priority must be executed first.
Market makers are assumed to incur a quantity-invariant order processing
cost, which is denoted by γ . I assume that the order processing cost is equal
for buy and sell orders. In the absence of adverse selection costs (i.e., α = 0),
the order processing costs would determine the bid-ask spread, and the order
book would offer infinite depth at the best quotes.
Suppose the price level p is the lowest price, above Xt , at which it is
profitable to supply a positive quantity. Consider the market-makers’ problem
of deciding how many units to offer at this price level. The expected profit
on the last unit, q, is determined by
E[(p1 − γ − E[Xt+1 |m])I (m ≥ q)],

(6)

where p1 − E[Xt+1 |m] is the difference between the price the market maker
receives and the expected fundamental value conditional on the market order
m, I (m ≥ q) is an indicator, which is 1 if the market order submitted is larger
8

Many specifications of this model, including the normal exponential version, yield a nondecreasing price
impact function. See Glosten (1994, p. 1137) for a counterexample.

715

The Review of Financial Studies / v 14 n 3 2001

than q, and γ is the order processing cost. We can rewrite Equation (6) as
follows using Equations (3), (4), and (5):
∞
q
1 u
1
(p1 −γ −Xt −h(u)) e− λ du = (p1 −γ −Xt −α(q +λ))e− λ . (7)
2λ
2
q
Market makers are profit maximizing, and therefore the quantity offered at
the price level p must be such that the last unit breaks even. This implies
that the quantity Q1 submitted at the best sell price level p1 is given by
Q1 =

p1 − γ − Xt
− λ.
α

(8)

Given that the quantity Q1 is offered at p1 we can now ask what quantity the
market makers will offer at the next price level, p2 . Using similar arguments
we find that the quantity offered at the second-best price level, Q2 , is given by
Q2 =

p2 − γ − Xt
− Q1 − λ.
α

(9)

By recursively following the procedure described above we can construct the
whole limit order book on the offer side. By analogy we can construct the
order book on the bid side.
The model presented above is static and therefore we cannot make predictions about the timing of limit order submissions. One way to think about the
liquidity provision is to allow one market maker to enter and replenish the
limit order book until all price levels satisfy the conditions presented above.
Alternatively, several market makers could enter and compete for the profit
opportunities in the limit order book. Provided that enough market makers
regularly observe the status of the limit order book, profit opportunities will
tend to be short-lived.
3. Empirical Methodology
The theoretical model discussed here imposes restrictions on the price and
quantities in the limit order book as well as on the joint dynamics of the
fundamental value and the order books. This section develops these two types
of restrictions in more detail. The empirical strategy, which is subsequently
outlined, builds directly upon these restrictions.
3.1 Break-even conditions
The model framework presented in Section 2 implies that the limit order book
at time t is characterized by a set of break-even conditions. I concentrate
on the restrictions that apply to the two best bid and ask quotes. The sharp
distinction between the time of limit and market order arrivals that the model
is based upon does not account for the randomness in the arrival times of
716

Adverse Selection and Competitive Market Making

orders. It is also likely that the relevant model parameters change over time,
for example, the liquidity demand may depend on market conditions. In order
to bridge the gap between the model and data I assume that the break-even
conditions hold approximately by introducing an error term in each breakeven condition. Let the error terms corresponding to the different price levels
be denoted by k , k = ±1, ±2. The offer side break-even conditions given
in Equations (8) and (9) can then be restated as
 k


Q i + λ = k
k = +1, +2,
(10)
pk − Xt − γ − α
k

i=+1

where i=+1 Qi is the aggregate quantity offered at the +kth price level and
all price levels below the kth level on the offer side.9 Correspondingly, for
the bid side we have
 k


Q i + φ = k
k = −1, −2,
(11)
Xt − pk − γ − α
k

i=−1

where i=−1 Qi is the aggregate quantity offered at or above the −kth price
level on the bid side. The error terms capture the fact that at any point in time
the order book may offer profit opportunities or exposed limit orders. Market
makers are assumed to frequently enter the market and update their outstanding limit orders in the order book and potentially add new limit orders when
the order book exhibits profit opportunities. I assume that on average the
limit order book does not exhibit exposed limit orders or unexploited profit
opportunities, that is, E[k ] = 0 for all k.
In order to eliminate the unobserved fundamental value, Xt , I difference
the equations above.10 The sum of the +kth and −kth break-even conditions,
Equations (10) and (11), then result in the following two moment conditions:


E[e1 (yt , ϕ)] = E p+1 − p−1 − 2γ − α(Q+1 + λ + Q−1 + φ) = 0 (12)
and

(13)

where yt denotes the time t vector of data, {pk , Qk }k=+2
k=−2 , and ϕ denotes the
vector of parameters, {α, γ , λ, φ}.
9

I could also allow the parameters to vary with time-varying instruments, but the development of the estimation
strategy assumes that they are constant.

10

In principle, I could have developed the break-even conditions based on the expected marginal profit,
Equation (7), instead of the marginal profit conditional on execution, as in Equations (8) and (9). The advantage of the latter is that it makes it straightforward to eliminate the unobservable fundamental value, Xt .

717

3.2 Updating restrictions and order book revisions
The law of motion for the fundamental value given in Equation (2), together
with the price impact function h(m) given in Equation (5), provides a link
between the changes in the limit order books over time and the market order
flow. This link will be used to generate another set of restrictions on the data
that complement the information in the break-even conditions.
The change in the fundamental value from time t to time t + 1 is given by
Xt+1 − Xt = µ + h(mt ) + νt+1 = µ + αmt + νt+1 ,

(14)

where νt+1 is an expectation update that is orthogonal to mt and αmt is the
price impact of the time t market order. The limit order books on the offer
side at time t and time t + 1 are characterized by break-even conditions as
in Equation (10):

pk, t − Xt − γ − α

we get

I rule out a market order flow mt that depends on the state of the order book
and assume that the market order flow is uncorrelated with the profit opportunities in the order book at every price level. In other words, I assume that
E[mt k, t ] = 0 for all k. Furthermore, I assume that the order book is replenished quickly enough after each trade so that any deviation at time t +1 from
the break-even conditions is uncorrelated with the previous time t market

order, that is, I assume that E[mt k, t+1 ] = 0 for all k.11 Given these assumptions, two additional conditions that apply to the offer side are obtained:

and two restrictions for the bid side:
E[e5 (yt , ϕ)] = E['p−1 + α(Q−1,t+1 − Q−1, t ) − µ − αmt ] = 0

where 'pj = pj,t+1 − pj, t .
An additional set of moment conditions is obtained by forming the difference between the expected values of the buy and sell market order quantities
and the parameters λ and φ, respectively. These restrictions are given by
E[e7 (yt , ϕ)] = E[mt − λ|mt > 0] = 0,
E[e8 (yt , ϕ)] = E[mt + φ|mt < 0] = 0.

(23)

A vector of moment conditions denoted gt (yt, ϕ) is obtained by stacking
all the moment conditions as gt (yt, ϕ) = [e1 (yt , ϕ) · · · e8 (yt , ϕ)]. A GMM
estimator of the parameter vector ϕ can then be defined as
	 T

T t=1 t t,
where WT is a positive definite weighting matrix. Hansen (1982) proves that
the GMM estimator of ϕ is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed.
The variance-covariance matrix of ϕT is given by -Tϕ = [D0 S0−1 D0 ]−1 , where


t (ϕ)
] and S0 ≡ s=+∞
D0 ≡ E[ ∂g∂ϕ
s=−∞ E[gt gt−s ]. A consistent first-round estimate is obtained by using the identity matrix as the weighting matrix. In
the second round, a heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation-consistent estimate
of the variance-covariance matrix S0 is obtained by using the Newey–West
procedure.

I thank the editor for pointing out the importance of these assumptions.

4. Empirical Results
In this section I first report estimation results based on applying the breakeven and updating conditions separately and then the results from applying
them jointly. The second subsection analyzes the properties of the market
order distribution in more detail. The third subsection presents the results for
an extended model that allows the parameters to change with time-varying
instruments. Finally, the last subsection addresses the importance of time in
the dynamic adjustment of the order books.
4.1 Tests of the main model predictions
Table 5 presents the model parameter estimates obtained by applying the
break-even and the updating conditions separately. The estimation based on
the break-even conditions utilizes Equations (12) and (13), and the mean
equations for the market order distributions, Equation (23). The estimates
of λ and φ, which characterize the distribution of market buy and sell order
quantities, are in general very close to the empirical averages of the market
buy and sell order quantities (divided by 100) reported in the last column
of Table 3. The estimated order processing cost, γ , is negative for all of
the stocks. It is, of course, unlikely that the true order processing cost is

Summary of estimation results obtained by imposing (i) the break-even conditions [Equations (12) and (13), and Equation (23)]
and (ii) the updating restrictions [Equations (19)–(22)] separately. Coefficients characterizing the market order flow (λ, φ),
the order processing cost (γ ), and the slope of the price impact function (α) obtained using the break-even conditions are
reported in the first four columns with corresponding t-statistics in the second row for each stock. Estimates of the drift (µ)
and the slope of the price impact function (α) based on using the updating conditions are reported in the fifth and sixth column,
respectively. A constant and the signed market order quantity are used as instruments in the second estimation. Given the four
moment conditions we have a total of total of eight orthogonality conditions. A chi-squared statistic for a test of overidentifying
restrictions (six degrees of freedom) is reported in the last column with p-values directly below.

negative. However, this could reflect rational behavior in a setting where limit
orders are placed by traders with heterogeneous valuations for the asset. It is
possible that a limit buy order that is suboptimal for a market maker in this
model is optimal for a trader with a high private valuation for holding the
asset. Such a trader will not use zero, the payoff from not submitting an
order, as the benchmark, but rather will compare the expected payoff on a
limit buy order with that of a market buy order.
The estimated slope coefficient, α, that determines the price impact of
market orders is positive for all stocks. It is interesting to note that these
coefficients are much larger than the coefficients inferred from the standard
price impact regression. Note that the data used to obtain the first set of α
coefficients reported in Table 5 include only “snapshots” of the limit order
book at different points in time as well as the market order series. On average
the slope coefficient obtained with the break-even conditions is about nine
times greater than the corresponding slope coefficient obtained using the standard price impact regression. Based on these estimates the adverse selection
cost for the marginal unit of an average size market order is between 10%
and 59% of the quoted bid-ask spread. The large discrepancy between the two
sets of slope coefficients is consistent with the large differences between the
price schedules and the benchmark presented in Figure 1. Using the updating
restrictions, which use time-series information, we would expect a smaller
difference.
The last three columns of Table 5 reports the estimation results based on
applying the updating restrictions in Equations (19)–(22). The order processing cost, γ , is not identified using these restrictions alone. Furthermore, the
updating restrictions do not depend on the order flow parameters λ and φ.
The drift parameter, µ, is close to zero for most of the stocks. The slope
of the price impact function, α, is positive for all stocks. Note that these α
estimates are smaller in magnitude than the corresponding estimates obtained
using the break-even conditions. There is large variation between the stocks,
but on average the magnitude of the α estimates obtained using the updating
conditions are only about 28% of the corresponding values obtained using the
break-even conditions. The magnitude of the α’s for the updating conditions
also exceeds the estimates reported in Table 4, but this difference is much
smaller. The main difference between the standard price impact regression
and the updating conditions is that the effects of price discreteness and time
priority, as well as the “upper (lower) tail” expectations, are appropriately
accounted for in the latter.
Using a constant and the market order flow at time t as instruments in
combination with Equations (19)–(22), I obtain a total of eight orthogonality conditions. The tests of overidentifying restrictions, reported in the last
column of Table 5, reject this specification for LME, PROC, and SEB at
the 1% level. One possible reason for these results is that not enough time
has elapsed for the order book to be replenished to the “equilibrium” levels.

Summary of estimation results obtained by jointly imposing the break-even and updating conditions [Equations (12) and (13)
and Equations (19)–(22)] and the market order conditions in Equation (23). The first five columns report the parameter estimates:
λ, the market buy order mean, φ, the market sell order mean, γ , the order processing cost, α, the slope of the price impact
function, and µ, the drift term. T -statistics are reported in the second row for each stock. The last column reports the chi-squared
statistic (three degrees of freedom) for the test of overidentifying restrictions.

This possibility is analyzed in the last subsection. The results in Table 5 indicate that the break-even and updating conditions lead us to make different
inferences about the slope of the price impact function.
Table 6 reports the results for the combined restrictions. By applying the
break-even conditions in Equations (12) and (13), the updating restrictions
in Equations (19)–(22), and the moment conditions for the market order
flow in Equation (23), I obtain eight moment conditions. No instruments
are used in this estimation.12 The system is overidentified, since only five
parameters are estimated. The λ and φ estimates are comparable to the estimates reported in Table 5. The estimated order processing costs are negative
and significant for all of the stocks. The estimated α coefficients tend to be
smaller than the ones reported in Table 5. The combined restrictions yield
estimates of α, the price impact coefficient, that differ from those obtained
using the break-even conditions alone by roughly 10%.
The tests of overidentifying restrictions strongly reject this model specification for all stocks. The key common parameter is α and it is therefore
clear that the discrepancy between the α estimates based on the break-even
and updating conditions is at least partially responsible for the rejections.
The order books together with the market order distribution suggest that
12

Note that unlike the estimation based on Equations (19)–(22) alone, we cannot use the market order flow at
time t as an instrument here since it is not part of the market-makers’ information set at time t. I thank the
editor for pointing this out.

quotes should be revised by a certain amount following trades. The actual
revisions in quotes and depths are in fact much smaller. Thus, based on the
observed revisions, we would expect to see more depth in the books.
The negative γ coefficients persist. As noted above, this could reflect a
trade-off between market versus limit orders made by liquidity traders. The
discrepancy between the α’s implied by the break-even and the updating conditions may be consistent with an order submission cost for market makers,
as in Seppi (1997), rather than an order processing cost. For example, it is
plausible that it is costly to monitor limit orders. This cost must be paid
whether or not the order is executed and may lead market makers to quote
larger markups (discounts) on limit orders with lower probabilities of execution, that is, limit orders further away from the quotes. It is beyond the
scope of this study to consider these alternatives. Instead I will consider the
present model framework and ask whether, within that framework, there are
good explanations for the results above.
To better understand how the model fails to match the data, it is useful to
consider how the price schedules we observe differ from those implied by
the model estimates. Figure 2 plots the average and median price schedules
(dash and dash-dot lines, respectively) based on the observed limit order
books as in Figure 1. In addition, two implied price schedules based on the
estimation results reported in Table 5 are plotted. The implied price schedules
are computed based on the α estimates and the estimates of λ and φ, which
together determine the “upper tail” and “lower tail” expectations. The implied
price schedules are computed for the market order quantities that match the
percentiles reported in Table 3. All four price schedules are normalized to
have a zero “price" for a trade size of one roundlot. Thus the graphs are
designed to capture effects that are related to the market order quantities
rather than quantity-invariant effects. The solid lines, which correspond to
the α estimates obtained using break-even conditions, are closer to the actual
schedules. The dotted lines represent the price schedules implied by the α
estimates using the updating conditions. As in Figure 1, these schedules are
close to zero. That is, prices respond less to trades than the schedules would
suggest.
4.2 Market order distribution
One potential explanation for the rejections reported above is that the
parametrization used for the market order distribution, two-sided exponential,
provides a poor approximation of the empirical distribution. Alternatively, the
conditional market order distribution could depend on the state of the market,
that is, the assumption of an exogenous order flow is incorrect.
Figure 3 presents a comparison of the empirical and the implied distributions for ASEA and ASTR.13 The empirical distribution of market order

Comparison of Implied (Model) and Observed Price Schedules
The time-series mean (dashed line) and median (dash-dot line) of the markup or discount (measured in
Swedish Crowns on the vertical axis) that a trader submitting hypothetical market orders of different sizes
[measured in roundlots (100 shares) on the horizontal axis] would have paid or received relative to the midquote are plotted for two stocks, ASEA and ASTR. The markups and discounts are computed for the marginal
unit of each market order size as follows. For each limit order book observed before a transaction, the markup
(discount) that market orders of various sizes would pay or receive, respectively, are computed. The market
order sizes are chosen to match the order flow by percentiles reported in Table 3. The solid line in each plot
corresponds to the price schedules implied by the α estimates based on the break-even conditions (see Table 5).
The dotted line represents the price schedules implied by the α estimates based on the updating conditions
(see Table 5). The price schedules are normalized so that a one round-lot trade has a zero markup/discount.

quantities is plotted (bars) against the distribution implied by the exponential
function and the parameter estimates for λ and φ (solid line) in the subplots
on the left. For both stocks there seems to be significant “clustering" that the
exponential distribution cannot capture. There appear to be more orders close
to zero and far away from zero than we would expect if the true distribution
was an exponential with a parameter equal to the average order size. This
is potentially a problem as the adverse selection cost in the model is based
on “upper tail” and “lower tail” expectations that may be sensitive to these
types of deviations.
To further study how the assumed functional form may affect the results,
I computed the “upper tail” and “lower tail” expectations implied by the
estimated distribution. In Figure 3 the graphs on the right show the implied
“upper (lower) tail” expectations for the market order flow, for example,

Distribution of Market Orders and “Upper (Lower)” Tail Expectations
The distribution of market order quantities implied by the parameter estimates (λ and φ) reported in Table 6
(solid line) and the empirical distribution of market order quantities (bars) are plotted on the left for ASEA
and ASTR, respectively. The plots on the right show the “upper tail” expectations and the absolute value of
the “lower tail” expectations computed based on (i) the estimated market order distribution (solid line) and
(ii) the empirical distribution (dashed). The market sell order quantities appear with negative signs. The units
for the market order quantities (x-axis) are 100 shares.

E[m|m > 500], based on the estimated distribution (solid line). The same
expectations based on the sample information are indicated with a dashed
line. The estimates produce “upper (lower) tail” expectations that are too
small. This difference grows as we move toward larger order quantities. This
suggests that the functional form assumption is partly responsible for the
rejections. Consider the effects of using a linear price impact function but a
distribution of market order quantities, which does a better job in matching
the “upper (lower) tail” expectations. This would allow us to capture more of
the “excess” slope in the order books without violating the updating restrictions. Basically a steeper price schedule could be generated without causing
too much overshooting in the dynamic updating. For example, update by αm
after a trade of m units, but E[x|x ≥ m] = km + λ, where k > 1, so the
price schedule is given by α(km + λ) rather than α(m + λ).
Assuming an exogenous market order flow distribution significantly simplifies the derivation of the equilibrium limit order book. However, it is plausible that in reality the market order flow is a function of the limit order book.

This table reports Spearman rank correlation coefficients for the best order book quantities and the market order flow. The rank correlation coefficients (ρ1 ) for the quantity at the best ask level in the order
book (AQ1 ) and the market buy orders (m, m > 0) are reported in the first column with the corresponding p-values in the second column. The corresponding correlation coefficients (ρ2 ) for the best
bid level in the order book (BQ1 ) and the market sell orders (|m|, m < 0) with p-values are reported
in columns three and four, respectively.

For example, it is likely that traders optimally choose between market and
limit orders or follow dynamic order submission strategies that involve order
splitting. It is beyond the scope of this article to formally consider a model
with endogenous market order flow. In Table 7, I report correlation coefficients for the order book quantities (best bid and offer quantities) and the
market order quantities (market sell and buy quantities, respectively). With
the exception of ASEA and LME, the correlations are positive and significant.
This means that larger market buy (sell) orders are observed more frequently
when the best ask (bid) quantities in the order books are relatively large.
Whether or not this phenomenon can explain the rejections above depends on
how the market order distribution interacts with the information asymmetry.
The above findings suggest two sets of empirical facts that could explain
the rejections of the main model restrictions. First, a flexible distribution for
market orders should do a better job of matching the empirical distribution
of market orders and thereby better approximate the “upper tail” and “lower
tail” expectations. Second, a richer model that allows for an endogenous order
flow would better match the empirical facts. One benefit of endogenizing the
order flow might be to match some of the substantial time variation in the
order books, documented in Table 2. Without changing the current model
framework we can still ask whether changes in market conditions can explain
some of the variation in the books.
4.3 Changing market conditions
It seems plausible that the relative intensity of informed and liquidity trading
changes over time. Changes in the arrival rate of earnings and macro news
could generate this type of behavior. Thus, we would expect that both the
distribution of market orders and the price impact of market orders would
change with market conditions. Of course, without a model it is hard to know
726

Adverse Selection and Competitive Market Making

what a relevant state variable is. With that limitation in mind the following
analysis focuses on a small set of reasonable state variables.
The variables used are the volatility of the mid-quote over the last
60 minutes (z1 ), the trading volume over the last 60 minutes (z2 ), and the
volatility of the market index over the last 60 minutes (z3 ). The state variables are normalized by subtracting and dividing by the average value of the
respective state variables. The first and the third state variables are selected to
capture changes in the arrival rate of stock-specific and market-wide information. The trading volume variable should capture changes in trading activity
and allow us to separate high-volatility periods with thin trading from highvolatility periods with heavy trading. The state variables affect all model
parameters except the drift, µ, which is assumed to be constant. The interaction is assumed to be linear and given by
λ(z) = λ0 + λ1 z1 + λ2 z2 + λ3 z3 ,
φ(z) = φ0 + φ1 z1 + φ2 z2 + φ3 z3 ,
α(z) = α0 + α1 z1 + α2 z2 + α3 z3 ,

(25)

γ (z) = γ0 + γ1 z1 + γ2 z2 + γ3 z3 ,
where λ0 , φ0 , α0 , and γ0 may be interpreted as the base case for the “average”
state and the other coefficients measure the effects of deviations from this
state. Table 8 presents the estimation results based on using the break-even
conditions [Equations (12) and (13)], the updating conditions [Equations (19)–
(22)], and the market order mean equations [Equation (23)], combined with a
set of instruments, which includes a constant, the three state variables (z1 , z2 ,
z3 ), and the first differences of the state variables ('z1 , 'z2 , 'z3 ).
In Table 8 we note that the coefficients that capture the effect of trading
volume on the price impact function, λ2 and φ2 , are positive and significant
for most of the stocks. Thus, this specification potentially captures some
of the endogeneity of the order flow. The coefficients for the stock-specific
volatility (λ1 and φ1 ) tend to be negative, six of the λ1 and five of the φ1
estimates are negative and significant at the 5% level. For the market-wide
volatility the results are more mixed, with some significant positive and negative coefficients and many insignificant ones.
The estimates of the order processing cost for the “average state” γ0 are
close to the estimates reported in Table 8. The state-dependent components
of γ are significant for less than half of the stocks and the estimates tend to
have both positive and negative signs. Thus the results for the order processing cost do not follow any general pattern.
The estimated mean slope for the price impact function (α0 ) is positive
and significant at the 1% level for all stocks. The α0 estimates reported here
are close to the α estimates reported in Table 6. The α1 and α3 estimates

are positive and significant at the 5% level for five and six stocks, respectively. This is consistent with a positive relationship between the adverse
selection cost and the stock-specific and market-wide volatility. The eight
significantly negative estimates of α2 indicate that typically adverse selection
risk is smaller when the trading volume is higher than normal.
Table 9 reports the results for different specification tests based on this
extended model. The first column reports the chi-squared test of overidentifying restrictions for the extended model. The test rejects for five of the
stocks at the 1% level. This suggests that the extended model performs better than the specification without state variables, but it still fails to capture
important features of the data. On the other hand, many of the coefficients
reported in Table 8 are significant and are consistent with economic intuition. Thus it is informative to perform some further specification tests on
this model. The last four columns of Table 9 report the chi-squared statistics
for tests of no state dependence for different parameters of the model. First,
a joint test of no state dependence for all four parameters (λ, φ, α, γ ) is
reported. This test strongly rejects, all p-values are less than 0.0001, for all

Summary of specifications tests for the extended model. The extended model allows the λ, φ, α, and γ parameters to depend
on the vector of state variables (mid-quote volatility, trading volume, market index volatility), as stated in Equation (25). It
is estimated using the break-even conditions [Equations (12) and (13)], the updating conditions [Equations (19)–(22)], and
the market order conditions [Equation (23)]. The first column reports a chi-squared test of overidentifying restrictions for the
extended model. The corresponding p-values are reported immediately below the chi-squared test statistic. The following four
columns report specification tests of no state dependence at all, no state dependence in the market order distribution, no state
dependence in the price impact function, and no state dependence in the order processing cost, respectively. The p-values for
each of the tests are reported below the chi-squared statistics.

of the stocks. Second, a test of no state dependence for the market order
distribution strongly rejects as well. The p-values for this test are less than
0.0001 for nine stocks and the p-value is 0.011 for one stock, SKAB. Third,
a restriction of no state dependence in the price impact function is rejected
for all stocks at the 1% level. Finally, a test of no state dependence in the
order processing cost rejects at the 1% level for five of the stocks. To sum up,
the specification tests imply that (i) accounting for changing market conditions appears to be important for all stocks, (ii) changes in market conditions
affect the market order distribution and the price impact function in an economically intuitive way, (iii) the order processing cost appears to be less
dependent on market conditions, and (iv) tests of overidentifying restrictions
still reject for five stocks at the 1% level.
4.4 Time to replenish the book
One aspect of liquidity provision that does not enter the model explicitly is
time. It takes time for the market participants to learn about profit opportunities or to find out whether their outstanding orders are exposed. Thus
it is possible that some of the observations we use in the estimation represent order books that are not at their “equilibrium” levels. It is also possible
that time affects the shape of the “equilibrium” order book along the lines of
Easley and O’Hara (1992)—periods of no-trade signal that information-based
trades are less likely to arrive and hence depth should increase or the spread
decrease. It is beyond the scope of this study to formally model the possible
effects of time in this setting. Instead, some indirect evidence on the possible
effects of time are reported.
Table 10 reports results for two regressions that were designed to capture
some of these effects. The residuals from the break-even conditions given by
Equation (12) were computed for the best bid and ask quotes based on the
parameter estimates reported in Table 6. In order to focus on the situation in
which there are “profit” opportunities in the book, the dependent variable is
the maximum of zero and this residual. Note that if the residual is positive,
it suggests that according to the model there is either insufficient depth at
the quotes, the bid is too low, or the ask is too high.
The first two columns of Table 10 report the results of regressing the measure of “profit opportunities” in the order book on a constant and an indicator
that takes on a value of one if the time elapsed from the last transaction is less
than the median time between transactions. The eight significantly positive
coefficients suggest that typically we see larger deviation or “profit opportunities” when a relatively short period of time has elapsed since the last
transaction. This supports the idea that it takes time to replenish the limit
order book.
The second regression takes the average time elapsed between the last
three trades as an independent variable. This measure captures changes in
the arrival rate of market orders. For seven stocks the coefficient on this

The table reports results for two regressions of a measure of price schedule errors on variables that measure the time between
arrivals. The price schedule deviation is computed as the maximum of zero and the residual from applying Equation (12), that
is, the difference between the actual and the predicted bid-ask spread conditional on the estimated price impact function and
order distribution. A positive value indicates that there are “profit” opportunities in the order book. The first two columns report
the coefficients and the t-values for a regression of the price schedule deviations on a constant and an indicator for fast trading,
that is, whether time since the last trade is below the median time between trades. The last two columns report the results for
a regression of the price schedule deviation on a constant and the average time elapsed between the last three trades.

variable is negative and significant at the 1% level. This suggests that longer
time periods between trades are associated with books that exhibit fewer or
at least smaller “profit opportunities.” Thus these regression results are also
consistent with the idea that it takes time to replenish the order book. They
are also consistent with the idea that periods of no-trade are informative,
as in Easley and O’Hara (1992). In their model longer time between trades
implies a lower probability of informed trading, ceteris paribus. However,
the generally negative relation between α and volume documented in Table 8
would seem to be inconsistent with this explanation.
5. Extensions
The results reported above were based on using the two best price levels in
the order books. However, the data used here, like most limit order market
datasets, include information about price levels deeper into the book. In principle, we can get better estimates by using these price levels when data are
available. On the other hand, as we move further into the book the one-period
break-even conditions that guide limit order submissions in the model may
be increasingly unrealistic. Limit orders submitted deeper into the book will
on average spend a longer time in the book before execution compared to the
limit orders around the best quotes. Therefore it is likely that the decision to
731

The Review of Financial Studies / v 14 n 3 2001

submit such orders is driven by multiperiod trade-offs between gains from
obtaining time priority at prices currently away from the quotes and the costs
of monitoring such orders. The current model does not address these types
of trade-offs.
In this analysis I used a particular parametrization of the model, a symmetric linear price impact function and a two-sided exponential market order distribution, which greatly simplified the derivations. Neither of these
assumptions is necessary in order to implement this estimation strategy.
Figure 3 shows that market order quantities tend to cluster on certain numbers of round lots. A general market order distribution that allows clustering
could be used in combination with a linear price impact function to match
the data more closely. A more general functional form for the price impact
function can be estimated by using a richer parametrization or without making any functional form assumptions. An outstanding question is whether it is
possible to identify the characteristics of an underlying distribution of information and hedging needs that would lead to a liquidity demand distribution
and price impact function consistent with the observed order book data.
6. Conclusions
In this article, I estimate and test a version of Glosten’s model of open limit
order markets. The empirical strategy is directly based on two types of restrictions that the model imposes on the data: the static break-even conditions and
the dynamic updating conditions. Break-even conditions for marginal orders
in the limit order book define the slope of the price schedule offered at a
given point in time. Updating restrictions determine how the order book or
price schedule responds to the information content in the market orders.
In the empirical implementation I find that there is a strong tension
between the adverse selection costs implied by the break-even conditions and
the updating restrictions. Combining these restrictions generates overidentifying restrictions that are strongly rejected in the data. Additional evidence
suggests that one important reason for the rejections is that the limit order
books offer too little depth or imply price schedules that are too steep relative to the order book changes in response to trades. Several explanations
for this finding are explored in the article: the functional form of the market
order distribution, endogenous order flow, time-varying market conditions,
and time itself. Allowing for time-varying market conditions, I find evidence
suggesting that the market order flow distribution and the price impact function changes with market conditions. In particular, the variance of the market
order flow distribution is positively correlated with the past trading volume.
The coefficients for the price impact function imply that the adverse selection risk is greater (smaller) in markets with higher (lower) stock-specific
and market-wide volatility and lower (higher) trading volume, respectively.

Adverse Selection and Competitive Market Making

Overall the empirical results offer some support for a specification with timevarying parameters. An interesting question for future work is to derive these
types of restrictions theoretically. Such restrictions would also be useful in
deriving cross-sectional tests for the order books in different stocks.
