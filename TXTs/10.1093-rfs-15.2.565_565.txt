Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) document individual stock momentum: strategies that buy stocks that have performed relatively well in the past and sell
stocks that have performed relatively poorly in the past generate signiﬁcant
positive returns over the 3- to 12-month horizon. This ﬁnding, obtained using
data from the U.S. market, also holds for a number of international markets
[e.g., Haugen and Baker (1996), Rouwenhorst (1998)]. What are the economic mechanisms behind individual stock momentum?
One approach to answering this question is to relate momentum to other
factors driving the cross section of expected stock returns. A number of
ﬁndings have emerged. Adjustments for factors such as the Fama and French
three-factor model tend to strengthen, rather than explain, momentum [e.g.,
Fama and French (1996), Grundy and Martin (2001)]. Contrary to the ﬁnding
of Conrad and Kaul (1998), cross-sectional differences in expected returns
is not an important cause of momentum [e.g., Jegadeesh and Titman (1993),
Grundy and Martin (2001)]. And contrary to the ﬁnding of Moskowitz and
Grinblatt (1999), a number of subsequent articles ﬁnd that industries (or
industry effects) do not explain momentum [e.g., Asness, Porter, and Stevens
(2000), Lee and Swaminathan (2000), Grundy and Martin (2001)]. Stock
price momentum is partially related to earnings momentum, but both past
returns and public earnings surprises (in a multiple regression) help to predict
subsequent returns at horizons of six months to a year [e.g., Chan, Jegadeesh,
and Lakonishok (1996)].
1. The Article’s Main Findings and Conclusions
Following this approach, this provocative article has two sets of ﬁndings.
The ﬁrst set is similar to the ﬁnding of industry momentum [Moskowitz and
Grinblatt (1999)]—for a set of industry portfolios, buying past winning portfolios and selling past losing portfolios generate positive returns for horizons
out to about one year. Lewellen ﬁnds that size and book-to-market portfolios

also exhibit momentum, similar in magnitude but distinct from momentum
in individual stocks and industry. These new ﬁndings add to the growing list
of stylized facts regarding stock price momentum. Like industry momentum,
size and book-to-market momentum can conceivably be consistent with any
number of explanations.1
The second set of ﬁndings is based on Lo and MacKinlay (1990), who
observe that the expected proﬁt of a momentum strategy might come from
three different sources. A stock that performed well relative to other stocks
might continue to do so because (1) the stock simply has a high unconditional
mean relative to other stocks (this source has already been rejected in the
literature), (2) the stock return is positively correlated, so its own past return
predicts high future returns, and (3) the stock return is negatively correlated
with lagged returns on other stocks (negative cross-serial covariance), so their
poor performance predicts high future returns.
Using raw returns, Lewellen calculates (separately) for industry, size, and
book-to-market portfolios the auto- and cross-serial covariances among the
portfolios. For each of these three sets of portfolios, the average of the autocovariances is slightly negative but is not statistically signiﬁcant. The corresponding average of the cross-serial covariances tend to be more negative
but are also not generally statistically signiﬁcant.
He draws two conclusions from these ﬁndings. First, the negative average of the autocovariances is evidence that momentum in industry, size, and
book-to-market portfolios are not due to past winners (losers) continuing
to be winners (losers). So this is inconsistent with the underreaction-based,
behavioral models of momentum such as Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny
(1998) and Hong and Stein (1999), which imply positive autocovariances
in stock returns. Second, the momentum in these portfolios is due to future
stock return being negatively correlated with the lagged return of other stocks
(negative cross-serial covariance), consistent with an overreaction hypothesis
in which certain stocks overreact to a common factor and others do not.
2. Our Main Points
Beyond the obvious issues with the statistical signiﬁcance of the auto- and
cross-serial covariance estimates, we argue that the two conclusions of the
article are unwarranted. First, we show with a simple example that his empirical ﬁndings can in general be consistent with momentum being due to the
underreaction to shocks. In other words, in general it does not follow that just
because raw auto- and cross-serial covariances are on average negative that
underreaction is not the source of momentum. Second, using an insight from
1

In a world with individual stock price momentum, one would expect that even portfolios created randomly
might exhibit some momentum. Grundy and Martin (2001) ﬁnd that this is indeed the case. And depending on
how the industry momentum strategy is constructed, they ﬁnd that the difference between industry momentum
and momentum in random portfolios is not statistically signiﬁcant.

this example, we show that the industry, size, and book-to-market momentum are not likely to be due to the overreaction hypothesis advocated by
the article. Instead, these ﬁndings are more consistent with underreactionbased explanations.
3. A Simple Example
Consider a one-factor world in which the only source of momentum is
underreaction to shocks. Assume there are N stock returns (think of them as
N industry portfolios) with the following one-factor structure:
ft = ft−1 + et 
rit = 	i + 
i ft + i t 

(1)

where et is a mean-zero serially uncorrelated shock to the factor ft and i t is
a mean-zero, positively serially correlated idiosyncratic shock with variance
2 and Ei t i t−1  = 2 > 0. The unconditional variance of the factor ft
is f2 . (Think of ft as the demeaned market factor.) The parameter  is the
serial correlation of the factor. All other correlations, serial correlations, and
cross-serial correlations are assumed to be zero. And assume that every asset
has the same mean and beta: 	i = 	 and 
i = 
 = 1. By construction, the only
source of momentum proﬁt in this setting is the positive serial correlation of
the idiosyncratic (e.g., industry) shock, which one can think of as due to
some underreaction mechanism along the lines of recent behavioral models.
Lets verify this by calculating the expected momentum proﬁt. Recall that
a momentum strategy buys stocks based on their returns in period t − 1 and
holds the stocks in period t. With this strategy, the portfolio weight assigned
to stock i at time t is
wi t =

1
− r 
r
N i t−1 t−1

(2)


where rt = N1 Ni=1 ri t is the equally weighted index return and 	¯ the expected
return of the index. By construction, the total investment at any given time
is zero. However, the dollar investments in the long and short sides of the
portfolio vary over time depending on the return realizations at time t − 1.
The time t proﬁt of this momentum strategy is
t =

N

w r 
N t=1 i t i t

Given the one-factor structure in Equation (1), the momentum strategy in
Equation (2) is given by weights in each asset of

Therefore the momentum proﬁt in Equation (3) is simply

It is easy to show that the expected momentum proﬁt is

(6)

By construction, it only depends on the positive autocovariance of the idiosyncratic shocks since the unconditional means and stock betas are assumed to
be identical.
Now, lets calculate the Lo and MacKinlay decomposition for our onefactor example. Recall from Lo and MacKinlay (1990) that expected momentum proﬁt is given by the following mathematical identity:
Et  ≡ 	2 + O − C

(7)

where the ﬁrst term, 	2 , is the cross-sectional variance of expected returns
given by
	2 =

N

(8)

the second term, O, is the average autocovariance of raw returns given by

C = Ert rt−1  − 	¯ 2 −

(10)

Now, applying the formulas in Equations (8)–(10) to our one-factor example, it is easy to show that 	2 = 0 (as expected), that

and that

Notice that 	2 + O − C = NN−1 2 , which is simply the expected momentum
proﬁt calculated above in Equation (6).

Discussion of “Momentum and Autocorrelation in Stock Returns”

When the common factor is serially correlated ( = 0), the average
autocovariance O naturally depends on the autocovariances of the idiosyncratic shocks and the common factor. The expected momentum proﬁt E
depends only on the autocovariance of the idiosyncratic shocks (and not of
the common factor) by construction. Hence the cross-serial covariance term
C has to be such that the identity given in Equation (7), the Lo and MacKinlay decomposition, holds.
So even though momentum proﬁts do not depend on , the Lo and MacKinlay decomposition does. It yields negative auto- and cross-serial covariances
or positive ones depending on the serial correlation of the factor during
the sample period over which the decomposition is done. From Equations
(11) and (12), if the autocorrelation of the common factor is positive, then
O and C are positive. If it is sufﬁciently negative, then both O and C
are negative.
We draw two conclusions from this simple example. First, the Lo and
MacKinlay decomposition is not informative in general about the underlying
economic source of momentum proﬁt. Second, momentum due to underreaction can be entirely consistent with negative auto- and cross-serial covariances.
In our Table 1 we show that the ﬁndings of the article are likely to be
driven by the serial correlation of the market factor in sample. In panel A
we calculate the momentum proﬁts using a set of 20 industry portfolios
based on the strategy given in Equation (2) using past six-month returns.

Value-weighted industry portfolios are formed using all common U.S. stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq. The industry
classiﬁcations are based on two-digit SIC codes following Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) and produce 20 industries: mining,
food, apparel, paper, chemical, petroleum, construction, primary metals, fabricated metals, machinery, electrical equipment,
transportation equipment, manufacturing, railroads, other transportation, utilities, department stores, retail, ﬁnancials, and others.
Returns are cumulated every six months over January–June and over July–December. Momentum strategies are formed every
January and July based on prior six-month returns. The strategies are given in Equation (2). Panel A reports the momentum
proﬁts expressed as semiannual returns and the serial correlation estimate of the market factor (value-weighted CRSP), ,
calculated using six-month return. Panel B reports the Lo and MacKinlay decomposition of expected momentum proﬁt given in
Equation (7). Panel C reports the Jegadeesh and Titman decomposition of expected momentum proﬁt given in Equation (14).
Due to estimation error, this decomposition does not always add up to the momentum proﬁt.

The numbers are 0.072% semiannual during the 1941–1999 and 0.064%
semiannual during 1928–1999. They are similar to the ones reported in the
article. The momentum proﬁts in the two periods are roughly the same. We
also report the serial correlation in the market factor (value-weighted CRSP)
using six-month returns. The numbers are −004 during the 1941–1999 and
0.08 during 1928–1999. In panel B we report the corresponding the Lo and
MacKinlay decomposition given by Equations (7)–(10). During 1941–1999,
the cross-serial covariance term C is negative and the autocovariance term O
is also negative. During 1928–1999, C is now positive and O is positive as
well, just as our one-factor example predicts.
In fact, we have replicated some of the ﬁndings on cross-serial covariances
(measured at different horizons) reported in the article’s Table 6. We ﬁnd
that these magnitudes are similar to the values predicted by Equation (12).
In other words, it appears that a sizeable fraction of the article’s ﬁndings is
due to the in-sample negative serial correlation of the market as opposed to
an overreaction mechanism advocated by the article.
4. An Alternative Decomposition of Expected Momentum Proﬁt
As the simple example clearly shows, the Lo and MacKinlay decomposition is not in general informative about the economic sources of momentum,
resulting in potentially misleading inferences. How then do we go about testing an overreaction-based explanation of momentum? Jegadeesh and Titman
(1995) provides an answer to this question. Suppose that stocks follow the
following factor structure:
r i t = 	i + b0 i ft + b1 i ft−1 + i t 

(13)

where ft is the unexpected factor realization, i t is the asset speciﬁc component of return at time t, and (b0 i  b1 i ) are the time-invariant sensitivities
of stock i to the contemporaneous and lagged realizations of the factor.
This model is similar to conventional multifactor models except that it
allows for the lagged factor sensitivities to be different from zero. To see
how this speciﬁcation will generate momentum due to overreaction, imagine
that there are only two industries A and B, with say (b0 A = 13 b1 A = 0) and
(b0 B = 09 b1 B = −01). In this case, a naïve strategy of buying the winning
industry and selling the losing industry is proﬁtable because of cross-serial
covariances due to the overreaction of industry B. Suppose that there is a
positive factor realization, so A is the winning industry. Then buying industry
A and selling industry B is proﬁtable since industry B overreacts to the
positive factor shock (and has negative future returns on average). Suppose
that there is a negative factor shock, so A is the losing industry. Then the
strategy calls for selling industry A and buying B. This is proﬁtable because
B overreacts to the negative factor shock (and has positive future returns on
average).

Discussion of “Momentum and Autocorrelation in Stock Returns”

The expected momentum proﬁts under Equation (13) is shown by Jegadeesh
and Titman (1995) to be given by
Et  = 	2 +  + f2 

(14)

where the ﬁrst term, 	2 , is the cross-sectional variance of expected returns
given in Equation (8), the second term, , is the average idiosyncratic
autocovariance given by
=

N
N −1 
covi t  i t−1 
N 2 i=1

(15)

and the third term, , is the contribution to momentum proﬁts from the
differential overreaction to the common factor given by
=

N
1 
b − b̄0 b1 i − b̄1 
N i=1 0 i

(16)

where b̄0 i and b̄1 i are the averages of b0 i s and b1 i s, respectively. In the
context of the two-industry example given above, it is easy to see that  > 0.
If overreaction is a signiﬁcant contribution for momentum, then we ought
to see this latter term contributing a signiﬁcant amount to the total momentum proﬁt.
We perform this Jegadeesh and Titman decomposition for the portfolios
in our Table 1. For each of the 20 time series of industry portfolios, we
estimate Equation (14) using the (demeaned) value-weighted market CRSP
index as the proxy for the common factor. This estimation yields estimates
for (	i  b0 i  b1 i ) for each of the 20 time series. With these estimates we
can calculate the residuals i t for each of the 20 industry portfolios. This
allows us to calculate the autocovariance for these time series of residuals
and to average these autocovariances to get an estimate of . It is also easy
to estimate  and f2 .
Panel C of Table 1 reports the results of this decomposition for the 1928–
1999 and the 1941–1999 time periods. Notice that in both instances,  > 0
and is responsible for all the momentum proﬁts, whereas the cross-serial
covariance term f2 is nearly zero. In other words, the overreaction model
of Equation (14) is not likely to be driving momentum proﬁts, consistent
with our earlier ﬁnding that the in-sample serial correlation of the market
likely to be responsible for the observed negative cross-serial covariances.
Moreover, panel C conﬁrms that momentum is due to price continuation,
consistent with underreaction-based explanations.
5. Conclusion
This article contributes to the literature by documenting the existence of
momentum in size and book-to-market portfolios. However, the conclusions
571

The Review of Financial Studies / v 15 n 2 2002

that it draws from the Lo and MacKinlay decomposition of expected momentum proﬁt are unwarranted. We show that the article’s ﬁndings of negative
average auto- and cross-serial covariances among the portfolios can be consistent with underreaction-based explanations. We also show that these ﬁndings are driven by the in-sample serial correlation of the market factor and
not the overreaction mechanism advocated by the article. Our analysis also
suggests that doing such decompositions are not likely to further advance our
thinking on the economic sources of momentum.
Rather, we ought to develop stock price models that not only ﬁt various stock price predictability patterns such as momentum, but also generate
new and testable predictions [see, e.g., Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998),
Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), and Hong and Stein (1999)].
While these models are far from being able to simultaneously reconcile all
the behaviors of the time series of the market and the cross-section of stock
returns, they have yielded new insights into the sources of individual stock
price momentum. For instance, Hong, Lim, and Stein (1998) ﬁnd evidence
consistent with the “gradual diffusion of information” hypothesis of Hong
and Stein (1999). They ﬁnd that the proﬁtability of momentum strategies
declines sharply with ﬁrm size and (controlling for size) is much more profitable for ﬁrms with little analyst coverage. Moreover, the effect of coverage
also matters more for stocks that are past losers than for past winners. Other
empirical articles motivated by these theories include Lee and Swaminathan
(2000), who ﬁnd that momentum is more pronounced in high-volume ﬁrms
than low-volume ﬁrms and get reversed at long horizons of three to ﬁve
years. More work along this line needs to be done.
