The pricing of A-shares in China has long puzzled ﬁnancial
economists. This paper applies recent tests of stochastic dominance
(SD) to examine whether differences in the return distributions of
A- and B-shares in China are consistent with market efﬁciency. As
SD is nonparametric, market efﬁciency can be examined without
the joint test problem arising from misspeciﬁcations in the asset
pricing benchmark. Our results show A-shares have second-order
dominated B-shares from 1996 to 2005. This dominance was most
signiﬁcant during the market segmentation period, but has continued, albeit to a lesser extent even after the B-share market was
opened to local investors in 2001. Our results are robust to using
residual returns from an international asset pricing model instead
of raw returns. We conclude that the superior performance of Ashares cannot be attributed to risk. The results are more likely due to
a return bias caused by intense speculation among retail individuals
under limited arbitrage.

1. Introduction
The pricing of A-shares in China has long been a puzzle to ﬁnancial economists. China is unique
among emerging markets because A-shares, which are restricted to Chinese citizens, are priced at huge
premiums over B-shares, which are restricted to foreigners. Despite the opening of the B-share market
to local investors in 2001, the A-share premium has persisted. A large literature has tried to explain

the source of this price differential. Recent contributions to this literature include Mei et al. (2005) and
Chan et al. (2008).
Several studies argue that China’s stock markets are mainly driven by speculation and insider trading. Allen et al. (2006) point out that the desire for quick gains combined with lack of strong legal
framework in China fostered a speculative attitude among investors. Mei et al. (2005) point out that
share prices probably contain a speculative component due to a limited share ﬂoat and prohibitions on
short sales. Moreover, since the A-share market is dominated by unsophisticated individual investors,
the size of the A-share premium is a direct reﬂection of this speculative component. Using A-share
turnover as a proxy for speculation, Mei et al. ﬁnd that stocks with a higher turnover tend to trade at
higher premiums, which is consistent with the speculative demand hypothesis.
Chan et al. (2008) provide an alternative explanation of the B-share discount based on the notion
of information asymmetry. Speciﬁcally, they argue that foreign investors are less informed about the
Chinese market than locals. Hence, they demand a price discount for B-shares to compensate for
this information disadvantage. Consistent with their hypothesis, they ﬁnd that B-share discounts are
positively related to measures of information asymmetry that are constructed using bid-ask spreads
of A- and B-shares. Furthermore, A-share turnover has no signiﬁcant impact on this discount after
accounting for information asymmetry.
While these studies shed light on factors that explain the cross-section of A-share premiums, they
do not explain why such a premium exists in the ﬁrst place. Existing debate on the sources of the A-share
premium have also missed another intriguing aspect of the Chinese stock market. That is, there exists
a higher average return of A-shares relative to the average return of B-shares. For example, between
January 1996 and February 2001, A-shares outperformed B-shares with average annual returns of 30%
and 12%, respectively. This large mean return differential has led to a dramatic increase in A-share
premium over the same period. Even after the B-share market was opened to local investors, A-shares
still outperformed B-shares. The average annual returns of A-shares and B-shares in the bear market
from June 2001 to December 2005 were −14% and −19%, respectively.
Classical ﬁnance argues that markets are efﬁcient in promoting price discovery, which leaves no
room for noise traders to inﬂuence asset prices. This sanguine view has been challenged by mounting evidence from behavioral ﬁnance. There is convincing evidence that when stocks are favored by
individual investors and difﬁcult to value, they are prone to mispricing. For example, Kumar and Lee
(2006) ﬁnd that ﬁrms with high retail concentration and ﬁrms that are more difﬁcult to arbitrage have
consistently high loadings on measures of investor sentiment. Baker and Wurgler (2006) show that
sentiment-driven buying leads to return reversals, which is consistent with ex-ante overvaluations.
They show that this effect is more signiﬁcant among small, young, highly volatile, unproﬁtable, and
non-dividend paying ﬁrms as well as among extreme value and growth ﬁrms. A common denominator
is that these ﬁrms have highly subjective valuations.
It is natural to think of mispricing as stochastic. Recent work by Brennan and Wang (2007) provide
some insights into the relation between stochastic mispricing and the behavior of asset returns. They
show that even if a stock trades on average at its fundamental price, its average return may still be
biased above its fundamental required return. For example, let Pt∗ and Pt denote the fundamental and
market price of a stock. Suppose Zt is a stationary stochastic mispricing variable. Brennan and Wang
show that even if Zt has a mean of one, so that the stock price is unconditionally rational, Jensen’s
inequality implies that the expected return of that stock may still be biased above the fundamental
expected return (i.e., E(Rt ) > E(Rt∗ )).1 Empirically, they ﬁnd that this bias is larger for smaller ﬁrms,
low-price ﬁrms, growth ﬁrms, and ﬁrms with high turnover. Their results are generally consistent with
those of Kumar and Lee (2006).
Is the higher average return of A-shares consistent with market efﬁciency, or does it reﬂect a return
bias? It is plausible that noise trading could be prevalent in the A-share market due to the dominance

1
Consider the special case in which (a) the stock is non-dividend paying and (b) the mispricing variable is uncorrelated
with fundamentals. Let z = ln(Z) is a stationary, mean zero process, Brennan and Wang (2007) show that in this case, E(Rt ) =
∗
E(Rt ) + E(Zt+1 /Zt ) = E(Rt∗ ) + E(ez − 1). The convexity of the exponential function and the assumed stationarity of z implies that
the return mispricing bias is positive.

of uninformed individual investors and short-sale restrictions in the Chinese stock market. On the
other hand, advocates of efﬁcient markets may argue that A-share investors face more risk than Bshare investors because they are less experienced than B-share investors, who are mainly institutions.
Moreover, institutional investors can diversify easily across international markets, while exchange
controls in China limit diversiﬁcation for individual investors. Finally, poor minority investor protection
and imperfect regulation of markets may also cause Chinese investors to be more risk averse. As such,
the higher average return of A-shares could be a compensation for the higher risk faced by these
investors.
The goal of this paper is to test whether risk-based explanations can rationalize the high average
return of A-shares. The standard approach for testing market efﬁciency is limiting due to the need for
asset pricing model benchmarks. Despite the voluminous literature on asset pricing, this literature
has yet to identify equilibrium asset pricing models that can explain a large portion of time-varying
expected returns. Ghysels (1998) forcefully argues that in modeling expected returns, conditional
asset pricing models fare poorly compared to simpler static models. Harvey (1995) highlights similar
difﬁculties in modeling expected returns of emerging stock markets. Bailey et al. (1999) ﬁnd little
evidence that international asset pricing models can explain stock price differences in segmented
markets.
This paper relies on a different approach for testing market efﬁciency. Our approach is based on the
idea of stochastic dominance (SD). Because SD is nonparametric, SD tests do not require any speciﬁc
asset pricing benchmarks and thus avoid the joint test problem inherent in the standard approach. SD
rankings also have direct interpretations in terms of expected utility and thus provide an appealing
basis to relate investors’ revealed preferences to their risk attitudes. In particular, if the distribution
of returns is such that A-shares second-order stochastically dominates B-shares, then all investors
with non-decreasing, concave utility functions would unanimously prefer A-shares to B-shares. Put
differently, this result implies that no asset pricing model based on risk aversion can rationalize the
excess mean returns of A-shares.
We investigate the risk-based hypothesis for A-shares using a recent test for stochastic dominance
developed by Linton et al. (2005, hereafter LMW). An appealing feature of the LMW test is that it
allows for general dependence among assets as well as non-identically and independently distributed
observations. Thus, the test accommodates a rich variety of time series properties in returns including
weak dependence (␣-mixing) and conditional heteroskedasticity. To perform statistical inference, we
use a sub-sampling bootstrap method to estimate test critical values. Politis and Romano (1994) show
that this technique leads to consistent inference under very weak conditions. The use of bootstrap
methods to approximate critical values contrasts most SD tests that assume distributions are known a
priori. Simulations by LMW demonstrate that for samples with more than 500 observations, their test
has good empirical size and power properties.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the key institutional features
of Chinese stock markets. Section 3 describes the data and presents summary statistics of returns for Aand B-shares. As a prelude to stochastic dominance tests, an attempt is made in Section 4 to model the
returns of A-shares and B-shares based on a global asset pricing model for emerging markets. Section
5 introduces the stochastic dominance approach for testing market efﬁciency, and Section 6 reports
the results of the LMW test for A- and B-shares. Section 7 concludes the paper with a summary of our
main results.
2. Chinese stock markets
The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) were opened in
1990 and 1991, respectively, mainly to raise funds for state-owned enterprises. Despite their short
history, both markets have expanded rapidly, with the total number of listed ﬁrms increasing from
only 53 in 1996 to 1422 in 2005. Over the same period, market capitalization in the two markets
and across all share types rose from 100 billion renminbi (RMB) (or US$12 billion) to 3243 billion
RMB (US$391 billion), which is a compound annual growth rate of 9.5%. By the end of 2005, the
combined market capitalization of the SSHE and SZSE ranked 15th among the world’s largest stock
exchanges.

About 70% of shares on the two exchanges are owned by the State and state-related entities. As
state-owned shares are non-tradable, the share ﬂoat is very limited. Heavy concentration of equity
ownership in the hands of the State has often been cited as a key reason for the high demand for
tradable shares among local investors.
Before 2001, tradable shares were segmented into A-shares for locals and B-shares for foreigners.
A-shares are denominated in renmnibi (yuan) while B-shares are denominated in US dollars (if they
are listed in Shanghai) or Hong Kong dollars (if they are listed in Hong Kong). Other than ownership
restrictions and currency, these shares have identical voting rights and dividends.2 Despite their identical cash ﬂow and voting rights, B-shares have generally traded at large discounts to A-shares.3 Chan et
al. (2008) show that information asymmetry explains a signiﬁcant portion of cross-sectional variations
in B-share discounts. However, why such a discount exists in the ﬁrst place remains a puzzle.
While the growth of the Chinese stock market is impressive, the legal framework and institutions to
support market efﬁciency in China are rudimentary compared to Western stock markets. China did not
have a comprehensive set of securities laws until 1999. A code of corporate governance for listed ﬁrms
was not introduced until 2002. Even today enforcement of corporate governance practice among listed
companies remains weak. Under Chinese laws, the burden of providing evidence on corporate malpractice rests solely with the plaintiffs, who are usually individual (rather than institutional) investors.
According to the World Bank’s Doing Business Database (www.doingbusiness.org), China scored only
5 out of 10 in terms of overall minority investor protection. Yet, retail investors dominate the A-share
market in both the SSHE and SZSE. These investors also lack equity investment experience and are
likely to be poorly informed (Chen et al., 2007). In many theoretical models, uninformed investors
trade on noise or market sentiments because they lack reliable private signals (e.g., Brennan and Cao,
1996). Investor sentiment can be self-fulﬁlling and there is evidence that intense noise trading deters
arbitrageurs from making contrarian trades (Brunnermeier and Nagel, 2004).
Morck et al. (2000) argue that poor investment protection and weak regulations explain why stock
prices in China and other emerging markets are more “synchronous” (i.e., move up and down together)
than those in developed markets. Feng and Seasholes (2004) ﬁnd that buy and sell trades in China
are highly correlated over the same time period (such as a day). Mei et al. (2005) argue that the
high turnover of A-shares is consistent with a market where short-sale constraints induce investor
overconﬁdence and excessive trading. Their empirical analysis assumes that B-shares are rationally
priced.4
3. Data
Our data consists of daily returns of ﬁrms on the SSHE and SZSE with both A- and B-shares classes.
Our sample period runs from 1996 to 2005. Although the two markets were established in the early
1990s, their price movements and trading volume were erratic in the initial years. Moreover, liquidity is
a problem. This was especially true for the B-share market where days with zero returns were common.
To mitigate the problem of low liquidity, we start our sample in 1996. The full sample period is from
3 January 1996 to 31 December 2005.
Returns are computed using daily adjusted prices for 84 ﬁrms with A-B listings (42 from each
market). The data is obtained from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database

2
Dividends are in yuan for both A- and B-shares. Thus, foreign investors do face some cash ﬂow currency exposure. This
exposure, however, is limited by the fact that a large majority of Chinese listed ﬁrms pay little or no dividends.
3
A signiﬁcant price difference between A- and B-shares led to underground arbitrage trades whereby local investors use
securities accounts opened in the names of friends and relatives abroad to trade B-shares. As early as 1996, the International
Herald Tribune (20 June 1996) reported that “it appears. . .these days that anyone with a valid identity card and foreign currency
can now join in a fray where signiﬁcant arbitrage opportunities exist between A and B-shares.” A Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Report noted that by early 2001, more than half of the B-share market was owned by domestic investors. The report
also documented a signiﬁcant growth in non-bank foreign currency deposits held in Mainland banks in the late 1990s, which
indicates that domestic investors amassed hard currencies despite capital controls. By the end of 2000, these foreign currency
deposits account for 50% of total foreign currency deposits. See Ma and McCauley (2002).

If B-shares are rationally priced and foreign investors are less well informed than local investors, then B-share discounts
should correlate with the degree of information asymmetry. Chan et al. (2007) provides evidence that this is the case.

maintained by the University of Hong Kong and GTA Information Technology Company Limited. Prices
of B-shares were converted to RMB using exchange rates of 8.28 RMB to 1 U.S. dollar before 21 July 2005,
and the revalued exchange rate of 8.11 RMB after this date. To minimize ﬁrm-speciﬁc inﬂuences, we
formed value-weighted portfolios of A- and B-shares. The initial weights are each ﬁrm’s market price
multiplied by its number of tradable shares at the start of the sample period. Thereafter, the portfolio
is rebalanced when there is an IPO.5 To avoid the inﬂuence of IPO effects, we include a ﬁrm only 1 year
after its ﬁrst day of trading. We perform our stochastic dominance tests based on the returns of these
value-weighted portfolios.
Table 1 presents portfolio summary statistics of the data. For the full sample period, the mean
returns of A- and B-shares were about the same, but A-shares were less volatile. We also report
annualized Sharpe ratios computed using daily returns and the 3-month China deposit rate as the
risk-free-rate proxy. The Sharpe ratio of A-shares is high (0.92) and statistically signiﬁcant based on
the modiﬁed Sharpe ratio test proposed by Lo (2002).6 In contrast, the Sharpe ratio of B-shares is
only 0.21 and not statistically different from zero. Based on the arguments of Hansen and Jagannathan
(1991), the high Sharpe ratio of A-shares would require rather peculiar investor preferences to be
consistent with rationality.
The full sample period masks interesting differences in returns behavior over two major market
regimes. Before 19 February 2001, local and foreign investors were legally restricted to A- and Bshares, respectively. During this period, A-shares traded at very high premiums which averaged 460%
compared to B-shares. Investors’ revealed preference for A-shares is also reﬂected in the much higher
mean return of A-shares (29% per annum) compared to B-shares (12.5%). As seen in Fig. 1, the large
return differential between A- and B-shares led to a dramatic increase in the A-share premium over
this period.
Empirical evidence indicates that individual investors are attracted to attention-grabbing stocks
such as those with extreme returns and high trading volume (Barber and Odean, 2008). Using transaction data of nearly 47,000 individual investor accounts between 1998 and 2002, Chen et al. (2007)
ﬁnd that individual investors in China hold undiversiﬁed portfolios and trade more actively than individual investors in the U.S. Consistent with these studies, we ﬁnd that the average turnover rate of
A-shares (624% per annum) was much higher than that of B-shares (120% per annum) for our entire
sample period. This high turnover rate indicates a very liquid market for A-shares. However, it may
also be an indicator of investor overconﬁdence. For example, Miller (1977) argues that given shortsale constraints, only the most optimistic investors will be in the market. Extending this argument,
Mei et al. (2005) show that in equilibrium, stock prices will incorporate a resale option that captures the prospect of selling the shares to other more optimistic investors in the future at even higher
prices.
Trading activity on the B-share market is more subdued than on the A-share market. This suggests
that institutional investors who dominate the B-share marker adopt mainly buy-and-hold strategies.
Concerns over illiquidity of B-shares led the Chinese government to open the B-share market to local
investors. This policy change was announced on 19 February 2001, but came into full effect only from 1
June. Although prices of B-shares surged on heavy trading volume shortly after the announcement of
the new policy, the price adjustment continued over a period of months. Since this gradual adjustment
may have interfered with “normal” price transmission, we omit a “transition” period from our tests.
We deﬁne this transition period as the period from 19 February 2001 to 31 May 2001. Therefore, our
second (post-market segmentation) sub-period starts from 1 June 2001 and ends in 31 December 2005.
This second sub-period provides us with a natural experiment to examine the effects of the market
reform on stochastic dominance and market efﬁciency.
Fig. 1 shows that the A-share premium remained even after the liberalization of the B-share market.
The average daily premium for A-shares was still an economically signiﬁcant 40%. As the second subperiod was generally bearish, average returns for both A- and B-shares were negative over this period.

No ﬁrms in either portfolio were delisted in the sample period.
Both the Sharpe ratio and its standard error are modiﬁed to take into account of non-i.i.d. returns based on Eqs. (20) and
(26) in Lo (2002).

Note: This table presents summary statistics of daily returns on value-weighted portfolios of A- and B-shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The full sample
period is from 3 January 1996 to 31 December 2005. We also report statistics for various sub-periods, the dates of which are indicated in the table. The transition period are the ﬁrst
few months following the change of policy to permit Chinese citizens to buy B-shares. This policy change was announced on 19 February 2001 and came into full effect from 1 June
2001. “Return” is the average daily return expressed in percent per annum. “Stdev” is the standard deviation of daily returns expressed in percent per annum. Sharpe ratios are computed
using daily data and annualized using Eq. (20) in Lo (2002) which account for serial correlation in daily returns. Numbers in parentheses below each Sharpe ratio are autocorrelation and
heteroskedasticity-consistent p-values computed using Eq. (26) in Lo (2002) with 10 lags.

4. Asset pricing
4.1. The model
As a prelude to our stochastic dominance tests, we ﬁrst examine whether standard international asset pricing models can capture returns on the Chinese stock market. We do this for two

719

reasons. First, it may be premature to conduct stochastic dominance tests before asking whether
common risk factors can account for changes in expected returns. Second, residuals from our asset
pricing model can be used as a proxy for non-fundamental returns. Applying stochastic dominance
tests to these residuals allows us to test whether stochastic dominance can be attributed to nonfundamentals.
Following Bekaert and Harvey (1995), we consider a general asset pricing speciﬁcation that allows
stock returns to depend on world and local information variables and to display time-varying (asymmetric GARCH) volatility in the return innovations. The model speciﬁcation is as follows. Let ri,t denote
daily returns on A-shares, B-shares, or the world market portfolio. We use the Morgan Stanley Capital
International (MSCI) world market index as the proxy for the world market portfolio. The following
stochastic process for daily returns is assumed:
ri,t = i,t−1 + εi,t

(1)

The conditional mean return for the world market portfolio is speciﬁed as
W,t−1 = ı0 + ı1 Xt−1

(2)

where Xt−1 is a set of world information variables that includes a change in the U.S. Treasury-bill rate
(TBt−1 ), a change in U.S. Treasury bond term structure spread (TSt−1 ) measured as the difference
between the yield on 10-year Treasury bond and the yield on 3-month T-bill rate, and the U.S. corporate
bond default spread (DSt−1 ) measured as the difference between the Moody’s Baa bond yield and Aaa
bond yield.
The conditional variance for the world market portfolio is assumed to follow an asymmetric GARCH
(1,1) process:
2
2
W,t
= ˛o + ˛W ε2W,t−1 + ˇW W,t−1
+ W DW ε2W,t−1

(3)

where DW is a dummy variable taking a value of one if the world return innovation is negative, and
zero otherwise.
The speciﬁcation for the conditional mean return for A- and B-shares is
i,t−1 = ω0 + ω1 Xt−1 + ω3 Ct−1

(4)

where Xt−1 is as deﬁned above, and Ct−1 is the return on the Chinese stock market, a local information
variable. The Chinese composite stock index compiled by CSMAR is used to compute Ct−1 .
We assume that return innovations are dependent on world market shocks and model these innovations as εi,t = 	εw,t−1 + ei,t . Thus, a portion of unexpected returns is due to world shocks (εw,t−1 )
and another portion is due to idiosyncratic shocks (ei,t ). Idiosyncratic shocks are assumed to follow an
MA (1) process with asymmetric GARCH (1,1) conditional variance:

i,t
= ˛o,i + ˛i ei,t−1
+ ˇi i,t−1
+ Di ei,t−1
.

(5)

4.2. Estimation and speciﬁcation tests
We estimate the above asset pricing system using maximum likelihood under the assumption that
εW,t and ei,t are conditionally normal. To see whether the model can capture time-varying expected
returns, we carry out generalized method of moments (GMM) speciﬁcation tests. These tests calculate
moment restrictions under the null hypothesis that the model is correctly speciﬁed. Speciﬁcally, let
zi,t denote the standardized residuals for each return series. Under the null hypothesis, the following
population moment conditions should hold:
E[z̃i,t ] = 0

E[z̃i,t

of returns, respectively. The tests are based on ﬁve lags and the test statistic is

Table 2 reports the GMM speciﬁcation test results for the conditional mean speciﬁcation (C3), the

on ﬁve lags. The test statistic for (C3) and (C6) is 
2 with 5 d.f. and the test statistic for all restrictions is

2 with 14 d.f. The second to last row reports the GARCH asymmetry coefﬁcient () and the associated
p-value, while the last row reports a Wald test of the null hypothesis that the global information
variables are not signiﬁcant in the mean equation.
Table 2 indicates that the model can capture both mean and volatility dynamics for the three
return series. Since returns on the world index exhibit strong volatility asymmetry, this implies
that an increase in conditional variance tends to follow a negative shock. There are no signiﬁcant
asymmetry effects for A- and B-shares. Despite passing the above speciﬁcation tests, the Wald test
shows that the global information variables are insigniﬁcant in explaining the dynamics of A- and
B-share mean returns. Surprisingly, the lagged return on the Chinese stock market also has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on current A- and B-share returns. On the other hand, accounting for volatility
persistence plays a key role in capturing the dependence in stock returns. Overall, we conclude that
the model fails to explain the behavior of expected returns as a function of the macroeconomic
variables. While this result is disappointing, it is in line with the academic consensus that standard asset pricing models do a poor job in capturing time-varying risk premium in both developed
and emerging markets (see e.g., Roll, 1988; Harvey, 1995; Santis and Imrohoroglu, 1997; Ghysels,
1998).

5. Stochastic dominance
5.1. Overview
Given the limitations of the asset pricing approach, we propose an alternative method for testing
market efﬁciency that does not need asset pricing benchmarks. Our tests use a stochastic dominance
approach to compare risks. Unlike standard mean-variance analysis, SD does not assume that returns
have to be normally distributed or that investors have quadratic utility functions. It merely assumes
that investors choose risks to maximize expected utility.
5.2. Stochastic dominance criteria
Let F and G be the cumulative distributions of two risky assets, x the uncertain return, and U a vonNeumann-Morgenstern utility function. We assume throughout that investors prefer more to less, so
that U (x) ≥ 0. F ﬁrst-order stochastically dominates G if and only if
F(x) ≤ G(x) for all x

(6)

This means that F is preferred over G for all utility-maximizing investors. This is because there is less
probability of lower outcomes under F than under G for all outcomes x.
First-order stochastic dominance (FSD) is clearly too stringent a criterion for ranking investments. In
this paper, we focus on second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) which assumes that investors are risk
averse i.e., have increasing and concave utility functions. Since much of ﬁnance theory is based on risk
aversion, SSD is an appealing criterion to evaluate risky prospects. Furthermore, it seems reasonable
to assume that Chinese investors are risk averse given their lack of investment experience and the
existence of poor minority investor protection in China.
Consider a risk averter with utility functions U (x) ≥ 0 and U (x) ≤ 0. We say that F is preferred to G
by all risk averters if F second-order stochastically dominates G. This is true if and only if



x

[G(t) − F(t)]dt ≥ 0 for all x

(7)

−∞

Our econometric tests focus on SSD. If the return distributions are such that A-shares stochastically
dominate B-shares at second order, then no asset pricing model based on risk aversion can explain the
higher mean return of A-shares.
Third-order stochastic dominance (TSD) adds to risk aversion, the assumption of positive skewness
preference (i.e., the utility function is assumed to satisfy U (x) ≥ 0, U (x) ≤ 0 and U (x) ≥ 0). For such
investors, F stochastically dominates G at third order if and only if F > G (where  denotes expected
return) and

We also report results for TSD as positive skewness preference is theoretically appealing.
5.3. Econometric tests
We employ a test for stochastic dominance developed by Linton et al. (2005) to evaluate stochastic
dominance relationships between A- and B-shares. Unlike most stochastic dominance tests in the
literature, the LMW test does not require the data to be identically and independently distributed.
Thus, the test can be applied to data which exhibit time series dependence, such as GARCH volatility
and serial correlations.
The LMW test is set up as follows. Let {Yi }, i = 1, 2, . . ., N be a random sample drawn from a population
j
with cumulative distribution function (CDF), FY (x). Let DY (x) denote the function that integrates FY to

722

order j − 1. That is,
DY1 (x) = FY (x),

DY2 (x) =

(10)

(11)

where x > 0 for all cases. Let {Zi }, i = 1, 2, . . ., N be a random sample from a population with cumulative
j
distribution function FZ (x). Deﬁne DZ (x) analogously.
The LMW test evaluates the following hypotheses:
j

j

H0 : DY (x) ≤ DZ (x) for all x ∈ V and
H1 :

j
DY (x)

>

j
DZ (x) for some x ∈ V

(12)
(13)

where V is the usual joint support for the two distributions.
The null hypothesis is that Y dominates Z at the jth order.7 The alternative hypothesis is that stochastic dominance fails at some point. For our purpose, let Y and Z stand for A- and B-shares, respectively.
Our goal is to test whether A-share returns are too high to be justiﬁed by risk, where risk is deﬁned
nonparametrically by taking into account all information in the distribution functions. To answer this
question, we apply the LMW test to evaluate two null hypotheses. The ﬁrst null hypothesis is that Ashares stochastically dominate B-shares (H01 : Aj B) where “j ” indicate stochastic dominance at the
jth order. The second null hypothesis is the converse (i.e., H02 : Bj A). Accepting the ﬁrst null hypothesis and rejecting the second implies that A-shares stochastically dominate B-shares. If this test outcome
holds for second-order stochastic dominance, then no asset pricing model based on risk aversion can
explain the higher returns of A-shares since SSD preference applies to all risk averse investors. If we
cannot reject both null hypotheses, we infer that higher average return of A-shares is consistent with
risk and is therefore not an anomaly.
5.4. Test statistic and bootstrap-based inference
To test the two null hypotheses just described, we use the following test statistic proposed by LMW:
√ j
j
LMWj = sup N[DY (x) − DZ (x)]
(14)
x

where N is the sample size.8 Since the asymptotic null distribution of this statistic is non-standard, we
use bootstrap simulations to compute the empirical p-values.9 Following the suggestion of LMW, we
use a sub-sampling bootstrap procedure in which blocks of data are sampled without replacement to
estimate the distribution of the test statistic. The sub-sampling bootstrap technique has been studied
in detail by Politis and Romano (1994) who show that it consistently estimates the distribution of a
statistic under very weak conditions.
The LMW sub-sampling method requires computing (N − b + 1) times the following test statistic for
a sub-sample of size b:
j

LMWi = sup
x



j

j

b[DY,i (x) − DZ,i (x)] for i = 1, 2, . . . , N − b + 1

(15)

7
Strictly speaking, the null hypothesis as stated is one of weak stochastic dominance. We ignore the distinction between
weak and strong stochastic dominance since no general econometric test that we know of can distinguish between them.
8
We do not trim any part of the data in computing the test statistics.
9
The bootstrap is a non-parametric technique to estimate the distribution of a test statistic by re-sampling the data. It is
often used when the asymptotic distribution of a test statistic is difﬁcult to derive analytically. An advantage of the bootstrap
approach is that critical values are not dependent on any particular distribution assumptions.

W.M. Fong / Int. Fin. Markets, Inst. and Money 19 (2009) 712–727

723

The distribution of this sub-sample test statistic is then used to approximate the distribution of
Eq. (14). Since each sub-sample taken without replacement is in fact a sample of size b from the true
sampling distribution of the original data, the procedure has asymptotically correct size (Theorem 2,
Linton et al., 2005). In addition, by sampling blocks of observations (rather than individual observations), the procedure allows for general dependence in the data, which contrasts the i.i.d. assumption
of most SD tests.
Let p̂j denote the empirical p-value. We reject the null hypothesis at ˛ signiﬁcance level if
p̂j =

1
N−b+1

N−b+1



1 LMWi − LMWj > 0

Asymptotic theory requires that the sub-sample size b should be small relative to N, but provides no
other speciﬁc guidance. In our empirical analysis, we report results based on b equal to 5% and 10%
of the sample size. For each b, we form a sequence of 20 equally spaced sub-samples and perform
statistical inference using the median p-value of this sub-sample sequence as suggested by LMW.10
6. Results
6.1. Cumulative distribution functions
Fig. 2 plots the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and integrated CDFs for A- and B-shares
for sub-period 1 (market segmentation), the transition period, and sub-period 2 (post-market segmentation). The sharp rise in prices of B-shares following the policy change in February 2001 is clearly
reﬂected in ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance of B-shares over A-shares during the transition period
(plots C and D). Since returns in the transition period do not reﬂect normal price discovery, we perform
SD tests only for sub-periods 1 and 2. Fig. 2 shows that for these sub-periods the CDFs cross, indicating
no FSD dominance. However, the integrated CDF plots suggest the possibility of SSD dominance of
A-shares over B-shares.
6.2. LMW test results
Table 3 presents the results of the LMW test. The results are shown for the full sample period and
sub-periods 1 and 2. Consistent with the message from the CDF plots, there is no evidence of FSD
dominance in any of the sample periods. However, there is clear evidence of A-shares SSD dominating
B-shares. SSD dominance is especially signiﬁcant in the ﬁrst sub-period. In general, evidence for TSD
dominance is weaker than that of SSD dominance. Nonetheless, for the ﬁrst sub-period, TSD-type
investors would also have strongly preferred A-shares to B-shares. Overall, these results indicate that
the extremely high average return of A-shares in the ﬁrst sub-period cannot be attributed to risk.
The market reform announced in February 2001 should lead to some convergence of return distributions in the two markets. The second sub-period provides a natural experiment to test this hypothesis.
The results (panel C) are broadly consistent with the convergence hypothesis since there is weaker
evidence of stochastic dominance as compared to the ﬁrst sub-period. Nonetheless, A-shares still SSD
dominate B-shares at slightly below 5%.
As a robustness check, we apply the LMW test to residuals of the international asset pricing model
discussed in Section 4. This test amounts to a search for stochastic dominance after hedging out the
rational component of A- and B-shares returns. Table 4 reports the results.
Using residual returns does not change the main ﬁndings. First, A-share residuals SSD dominate Bshare residuals for the full sample and sub-period 1. Second, this dominance relation is stronger in the

10
Simulation evidence by LMW indicates that for large samples (>500), the sub-sampling bootstrap test is conservative when
the null hypothesis is correct, but nevertheless has impressive power when the alternative hypothesis for FSD and SSD is true.
The high power of the test implies that if no stochastic dominance is found, both null hypotheses can be accepted with high
conﬁdence. On the other hand, if H02 : Bj A is rejected, but H01 : Aj B is not, then this provides strong evidence that A-shares
stochastically dominate B-shares.

Note: This table reports the results of the Linton et al. (2005) test for stochastic dominance. The test is based on daily raw returns
for value-weighted portfolios of A- and B-shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. The entire sample period
is from 3 January 1996 to 31 December 2005 (2338 observations). Sub-period 1 is from 3 January 1996 to 16 February 2001
(1232 observations) and sub-period 2 is from 1 June 2001 to 31 December 2005 1106 observations). For each sample period,
we test two null hypotheses to establish the direction of stochastic dominance: H01 : Aj B and H02 : Bj A where j = 1, 2 and 3.
Statistical inference is based on median p-values obtained by sub-sampling bootstrap. The bootstrap simulations are based on

ﬁrst sub-period than in the second sub-period. To the extent that the residual returns reﬂect investor
behavioral biases, these biases were clearly most inﬂuential during the ﬁrst sub-period. This reinforces
our view that speculation rather than risk compensation was driving the returns of A-shares. That Ashares still dominate B-shares in the second sub-period indicates that there is some way to go before the
A-share market can be considered fully efﬁcient. Meanwhile, there are still many market frictions that
hinder price efﬁciency. Most notably, short-selling remains illegal and there are no equity derivatives
markets to speak of. Moreover, until China switches to a free-ﬂoating currency system, the renminbi
will remain a restricted currency. This deters individual investors from diversifying overseas. It also
deters foreign investors from active participation in the A-share market even though China partially
opened up this market in 2002.11 Revisiting these issues and their impact on market efﬁciency is an
interesting topic for future research.
7. Conclusions
China’s stock market presents an interesting setting to examine the effects of market frictions on
pricing efﬁciency. The market is relatively young, dominated by retail investors and lacks a strong legal
and institutional framework to protect investors’ rights. Moreover, market frictions such as exchange
controls and prohibitions against short-selling also limit arbitrage. Theorists such as Miller (1977)
argue that under this environment, speculative bubbles tend to form when investors have diverse
beliefs since only optimistic investors will choose to be in the market. Mei et al. (2005) argue that
market frictions and speculation may explain why prices of A-shares tend to exceed those of B-shares.
To date, however, reasons for the existence of the A-share premium have not been resolved. Although
the literature has identiﬁed liquidity and information asymmetry as important factors in explaining
why some ﬁrms have higher A-share premiums than others, the basic question of whether A-shares
are rationally priced is still open.
This paper shows that stochastic dominance tests can be used to test the efﬁciency of the A-share
market. We ﬁnd strong evidence that A-shares second-order dominate B-shares in the full segmentation period in China. Since this result implies that all risk averse investors prefer A-shares to B-shares,
the superior average return of A-shares in this period cannot be explained by risk, and is more likely
a reﬂection of market inefﬁciency.
The policy change of February 2001 provides us with a natural experiment to assess the impact of
market reform on market efﬁciency. Chan et al. (2008) ﬁnd that A-shares continued to dominate price
discovery at the daily level after the policy change. Likewise, our results show that A-shares continued
to SSD-dominate B-shares in the post-reform period. The higher turnover rate of A-shares may be
the main reason why investors remain attracted to this market compared to the B-share market. Our
results indicate that there is some way to go before the A-share market can be considered fully efﬁcient.

Currently, a select group of “qualifying foreign institutional investors” (QFII) is allowed to invest in A-shares up to a total
investment of US$10 billion. This QFII quota is likely to be raised in the future along with relaxation of foreign investment rules
such as currency conversion and repatriation of funds.
