This article presents a theory of capital allocation that shows how the use of net
present value (NPV) as an investment criterion leads to inefficient capital budgeting
outcomes and how this criterion may be dominated by other capital budgeting criteria,
like the internal rate of return and the profitability index. The essence of our theory
is rooted in the mainstream paradigm of corporate finance: while firms use NPV to
measure the addition to firm value from prospective projects, ``classical'' informational and agency considerations prevent it from implementing the optimal capital
budgeting outcome. Our theory also identifies conditions when alternative criteria
should be used. Finally, we characterize when direct monitoring through capital
budgeting dominates compensation contracts in alleviating the agency problem.

The use of net present value (NPV) as a criterion for project selection is a
standard tenet of scholars, students, and authors of corporate finance
textbooks. However, this consensus regarding NPV within the academic
community is at odds with findings on the actual practices of firms in
making investment decisions. Indeed, firms use criteria like internal rate of
return (IRR), payback period, and profitability index (PI) more often
than they use the NPV criterion in selecting projects.1 This discrepancy

For example, Stanley and Block (1984) report, for a survey of 121 multinational firms, that ``The internal
rate of return clearly dominates as the primary method with a 65.3 percent representation. The net
present value approach, often preferred over other methods in published materials on the subject, was
specified as the primary method in only 16.5 percent of the responses.'' This report is consistent with the
findings in Mao (1970), Schall, Sundem, and Geijsbeek (1978), Scott and Petty (1984), and Ross (1986).
For example, Schall, Sundem, and Geijsbeek (1978) study a sample of 189 firms and report that 74% used
payback (with only 2% using it as the sole criterion), 58% used accounting rate of return (4% using it
alone), 65% used IRR (6% using it alone), and only 56% used NPV (with only 2% using it alone).

between theory and practice raises the question: Are firms unaware of
academic recommendations regarding NPV as a criterion or are scholars
and financial economists unaware of the complexity and specific capital
budgeting problems and needs faced by firms?
Regarding the firm's perspective, the influx of MBAs into financial
management positions suggests that firms are aware of the academic
consensus about the use of NPV as a capital budgeting criterion. Nevertheless, despite this awareness, firms have not adopted NPV as their
dominant capital budgeting criterion. Indeed, in a recent exhaustive survey of multinational firms, Segelod (1995) finds that the IRR is still the
dominant criterion. Although use of the NPV criterion has increased over
the years (from 11% of firms requesting it in their capital budgeting forms
in 1964, to 33% in 1977, to 52% in 1990), it is still clearly a secondary tool,
as explained by the author: ``The NPV criterion has also become increasingly popular, although not as popular as the table may imply. Some of
the groups which use IRR use the NPV or the PI to interpolate the correct
IRR. Both criteria are requested on their forms, but the IRR appears to be
the principal criterion for these groups'' (p. 85).
In this article we present a theory that explains why and how firms use
different capital budgeting criteria in their capital allocation systems. We
explain the selection of capital budgeting criteria as a way to implement an
optimal capital allocation system. This approach enables us to identify
scenarios where the NPV criterion leads to inefficient capital budgeting
outcomes; this explains why NPV is often secondary in firms' budgeting
decisions to other criteria such as the IRR and the PI. Our theory is rooted
in the mainstream paradigm of corporate finance: while firms use NPV to
measure the addition to firm value from prospective projects, ``classical''
informational and agency considerations prevent it from implementing
the optimal capital allocation outcome. In fact, in many cases, it implements strikingly inferior outcomes.
To explicate our theory, we develop a model of a firm that consists of
two components: (1) top management, or ``headquarters'' and (2) divisional mangers, or ``the manager.''2 In this structure, the objective of
headquarters is to maximize shareholder value, while the objective of the
manager is to maximize her own utility. To alleviate the adverse impact of
these conflicting incentives, headquarters needs to design both monitoring
and incentive mechanisms. To this end, headquarters sets up a capital
allocation system that specifies the following: a capital budgeting criterion, and a wage compensation for divisional managers.

2

This structure has been used frequently by researchers of corporate finance. For similar modeling in the
context of capital budgeting, see, for example, Harris and Raviv (1996, 1998) and Stein (1997). Since we
assume headquarters perfectly represents the interests of shareholders, this model is similar to classical
principal-agent models [see Harris and Raviv (1979) and Holmstrom (1979)].

240

Why the NPV Criterion does not Maximize NPV

The difference between our approach and the ``textbook'' approach to
capital budgeting is best illustrated with a simple example. If headquarters
can observe, at no cost, all available projects, then the textbook NPV rule
will lead headquarters to select the project that maximizes shareholder
value. However, if headquarters cannot observe all available projects,
then the manager may manipulate the selection process by presenting
projects such that managerial utility is maximized.
To see how the manager may manipulate the selection process, suppose
that the set of potential investment projects for the firm includes two
mutually exclusive projects. The projects arrive randomly and independently; consequently one, both, or neither may become available. Suppose
the manager prefers a project that requires a larger investment, although
this project has a lower NPV. In this case, if both projects become available, and if headquarters uses the textbook NPV rule as its capital budgeting criterion, the manager may choose to request only the low NPV
project. As a result, the set of projects headquarters considers will differ
from the actual available set. Thus the NPV rule does a poor job in
restricting manipulations by divisional managers who privately observe
the availability of mutually exclusive projects. Depending on the underlying cash flow distribution and the severity of the agency problem
between managers and headquarters, a different capital budgeting rule
may be needed to ensure that the high-NPV project is selected. In other
words, while NPV is the best way to measure value added, in many
situations, it is not a good way to implement the selection of the highest
NPV projects.
Our theory shows why the NPV rule cannot implement the optimal
project selection outcome. If the NPV rule does not implement the selection of projects with the highest NPV, what mechanism does? In general,
the rules governing the project selection process may be very complex,
depending upon the economic environment. Therefore they may have
many restrictions and detailed guidance. However, we identify economic
environments where simple capital budgeting criteria like the IRR and PI
implement the optimal outcome. In different economic environments, the
firm has to choose between simple criteria and more complex criteria that
restrict the manager more efficiently but are more expensive to implement.
We argue that in many situations simple rules dominate more complex
rules. Therefore firms often use these simple criteria.
Our theory has a number of implications for both researchers and firms.
First, from an academic standpoint, our theory helps reconcile the textbook NPV criterion recommendation with actual firm capital budgeting
practices. Second, it lends insight into the capital budgeting process by
illustrating how modified forms of capital budgeting criteria can provide
optimal outcomes. For example, firms will use a modified IRR rule where
the hurdle rate is different than the risk-adjusted cost of capital. Thus our
241

The Review of Financial Studies / v 17 n 1 2004

theory can explain the puzzling finding in Poterba and Summers (1995)
that U.S. firms use real hurdle rates that are considerably higher than a
standard cost-of-capital analysis would suggest.3 Similarly, to the extent
that multinational firms investing abroad confront more severe implementation problems, our theory provides a possible rationale for the
often-criticized practice of adding a fudge factor to their cost of capital.
Our theory belongs to the growing capital budgeting literature. Antle
and Eppen (1985) show that in a setting of asymmetric information it is
optimal for firms to ration their investments in some states of nature. The
firm can do so by using a hurdle rate that is higher than the cost of capital.
In a related article, Harris and Raviv (1996) provide a theory of endogenous capital rationing as a way to curb empire-building managers while
benefiting from their private information. In a later study, Harris and
Raviv (1998) characterize when it is optimal for headquarters to delegate
to the manager the allocation of a total budget for two independent
investment projects.4 These studies show that NPV is an ineffective criterion because headquarters cannot know project NPV without verification
costs. However, our theory shows that, even if NPV is known, it still will
not implement the optimal outcome in these cases.
Narayanan (1985) rationalizes the use of the payback method by managers that prefer projects with early cash flows to enhance their reputation. Thakor (1990) provides a rationale for capital rationing in an
environment where the firm is cash constrained and therefore prefers
short-term projects in which the cash flow is realized sooner. This preference toward short-term projects may be implemented, for example, by
the payback method. In contrast to these models, in our model there are
no cash constraints and the capital allocation system is used to restrict
managerial discretion. Hirshleifer and Suh (1992) show, in a setting similar to ours, how compensation contracts are used to induce self-serving
managers to take high-value, high-risk projects. We endogenously solve
for the optimal method, wage compensation or capital budgeting, to
alleviate the agency conflicts.
In Stein (1997), a firm faces an exogenous capital constraint and its
informed headquarters allocates the limited resources to the better project
(``winner picking'') at the expense of the other project (``loser sticking'').
Trading off headquarters' monitoring ability against the efficient allocation of resources, Stein explains optimal scale and scope for firms. In our
model, headquarters does not face capital rationing, but can be manipulated by better-informed, lower-ranked managers.

Specifically, Poterba and Summers (1995) find that, during the past half-century, the average real
discount rate was 12.2%, distinctly higher than equity holders' average rates of return of approximately
7% and much higher than the return on debt of approximately 2%.

In previous work, Harris, Kriebel, and Raviv (1982) show how transfer pricing is used in allocating funds
within the firm in the presence of information and incentive problems.

242

Why the NPV Criterion does not Maximize NPV

Finally, our theory relates to the real option literature. This literature
has also identified a problem with the NPV criterion. Specifically, simple
NPV calculations can miss the real option value of a project, resulting in
rejection of value-creating projects whose option value exceeds the absolute value of their naive negative NPV. In this case, the wrong decision
results from miscalculation of the true NPV. McDonald and Siegel (1986)
and McDonald (1999) show that when the firm cannot calculate the true
NPV, it is optimal to use a hurdle rate or the PI criterion. In this respect,
our results are similar to theirs. However, in our article, headquarters can
calculate the NPV of all projects they observe.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 1 provides
the basic structure of the capital allocation process and characterizes the
optimal capital allocation system. Section 2 evaluates the effectiveness of
common capital budgeting criteria in implementing the optimal outcome.
Section 3 concludes. All proofs are relegated to the appendix.
1 A Model of the Capital Allocation Process


In this section we outline the model underlying our theory of optimal
capital allocation. In this model we consider a firm consisting of (1) top
management, or ``headquarters'' and (2) divisional managers, or ``the
manager.'' In this firm, the objective of headquarters is to maximize
shareholder value, while the objective of the manager is to maximize her
own utility. To maximize shareholder value, headquarters sets up a capital
allocation system specifying both rules for the capital budgeting process
and compensation for divisional managers. To abstract away from exogenous capital rationing issues, we assume that headquarters faces no
liquidity constraints. We assume that all agents in the economy are risk
neutral.
The main idea behind our theory can be demonstrated by considering
an investment opportunity set consisting of one business venture that
is implemented by two mutually exclusive projects. The only difference
between the two projects is the amount of capital required to operate the
respective underlying technologies. One project, project H, is more capital
intensive. The other project, project L, is less capital intensive. While the
characteristics of each project are known, there is uncertainty about which
combination of the two projects is actually available to the firm. The
arrival of projects L and H follows a binomial process with independent
probabilities of arrival, gL and gH, respectively.
The actual levels of investment and cash flow of each project depend on
a scale parameter, , representing the level of demand for the final product
of the firm. The cumulative distribution function of the scale parameter 
is F(). Specifically, the required investment for project m  L, H is
Im()  Im, where IL and IH are scalars that represent the underlying
243

The Review of Financial Studies / v 17 n 1 2004

technology. We further specify that IH > IL, reflecting the assumption that
project H is more capital intensive than project L. This assumption implies
that IH() > IL(). Regardless of the underlying technology, the expected
cash flow over period t is identical for both technologies. This expected
cash flow is represented by ct()  ct, where ct are known scalars. Note
that these assumptions represent a constant return-to-scale production
technology. Because of risk neutrality, the appropriate discount rate is the
riskless rate, , independent of the underlying technology.
Thus the

also independent of the underlying technology. Therefore the NPV of a
type m project is given by

In addition to project value, the model also defines manager utility that
creates an agency conflict. Specifically the manager's utility is defined over
her wage income, W, and firm size, as measured by the required investment, I, and is given by the following utility function:6
UW , I  W  I:

2

We assume that is a positive scalar, implying that the manager benefits
from larger-scale investment projects. For tractability, we assume that
the manager has no personal wealth and her reservation utility is zero.7
The assumption that the manager has no personal wealth implies that
W  0.
The sequence of events and information structure of the capital allocation process consists of three stages. In stage 1, headquarters establishes a
capital allocation system that specifies rules for the capital budgeting
process and managerial compensation. In stage 2, the manager privately
observes the characteristics of available projects. In this stage, the manager submits a capital budgeting request that specifies the required investment and future expected cash flow for each requested project. In stage 3,
headquarters evaluates the capital budgeting request, makes acceptance
decisions based on the capital budgeting rule, and pays the manager
according to the compensation contract. In this process we assume that
headquarters can perfectly verify the characteristics of requested projects
and cannot discern the availability, and thus the characteristics of other
5

The assumption that the future cash flow of project L equals that of project H is for convenience, and can
be relaxed as long as NPVH() < NPVL().

6

We use a linear utility function to simplify the analysis. The main results hold under a more general
specification.

7

If the manager's reservation utility were positive, headquarters could motivate the manager by shifting
wages between various states without incurring additional costs. Nevertheless, because there are no
negative wages, a positive reservation utility would not solve the incentive problem completely. Thus,
to simplify the analysis, we assume away this possibility.

244

Why the NPV Criterion does not Maximize NPV

projects. This assumption is equivalent to assuming a zero verification
cost to headquarters for requested projects, and infinite verification cost
for other projects.8
The optimal capital allocation system implements the best outcome to
shareholders, given the above information constraints and incentive problems. To describe this system, we solve the capital allocation problem
as a direct revelation game, where the manager reports project availability
and headquarters establishes a capital allocation system that maximizes
shareholder value subject to the incentive compatibility constraint that the
manager truthfully reports project availability.9 We solve for the optimal
capital allocation system conditional on , although neither the manager
nor headquarters observe the realization of  directly. This is possible
because both the manager and headquarters can infer the realization of 
from the characteristics of a requested project by solving   ct =ct .10
After solving the revelation game, we relate the solution to actual capital
allocation practices to evaluate the effectiveness of current allocation
practices in maximizing shareholder value.
In the revelation game, headquarters chooses project acceptance
probabilities and manager wages to maximize firm value.11 We denote
the acceptance probabilities by L(LH, ) and H(H, ). Specifically,
L(LH, ) is the acceptance probability of project L when the manager
reports both project L and project H. In this case, if project L is rejected,
headquarters accepts project H.12 Thus when the manager reports both
projects, the acceptance probability of project H is (1ÿL(LH, )). Likewise, H(H, ) is the acceptance probability of project H when the
manager reports only project H. We denote the manager's wage when
both projects are reported by W(LH, ).13 Consequently headquarters'

8

With finite verification cost, the optimal mechanism would be either the one in our model or a mechanism
with costly verification, as in Harris and Raviv (1996), depending on the magnitude of the verification cost.

9

By the revelation principle, we can solve for the best outcome to shareholders by considering only a direct
revelation game.

10

This assumption simplifies the analysis. The scale parameter  has an important role in the discussion of
complexity of different capital budgeting criteria in the beginning of Section 2.

11

Note that the manager cannot lie when no project is available, because headquarters can check any
project she reports. For the same reason, the manager does not want to lie when only project L is
available, because the only possibility to misrepresent the information is to report that no project is
available. For the manager, this possibility is worse than reporting only project L. Therefore, in what
follows, we will use the fact that the manager truthfully reports that only project L is available to set the
acceptance probability of project L to one when the manager reports that only project L is available.

12

In general, it is possible to put a lower probability on accepting project H, implying that both projects are
rejected with a positive probability. However, since a higher probability of rejecting both projects
decreases the expected utility to the manager from reporting both projects, a higher rejection probability
decreases her incentive to report the truth. Furthermore, this also decreases the expected value to
shareholders. Thus accepting project H when project L is rejected dominates.

13

Since the manager prefers to report project H, there is no reason to pay her any wage when she reports
only project H.

Equation (3) represents the ex ante value to shareholders. Specifically this

represents the incentive compatibility constraints for the manager for each
possible realization of .
We now outline the conditions for the optimal solution to the capital
allocation problem [Equations (3)±(7)].
Proposition 1.

(ii ) If gL < gL , then W(LH, )  0, H(H, )  1, and L(LH, )  0.
We now examine the capital allocation process in greater detail. In
Proposition 1(a)(i) and 1(b)(i), headquarters announces that it will directly
intervene in project selection without paying a wage. Headquarters
induces the manager to reveal project L by rejecting project H with a
positive probability. This rejection probability is chosen to satisfy the
incentive compatibility constraint of the manager. In particular, if the
manager reports project L, this project is accepted, resulting in utility
IL() to the manager. However, if the manager reports project H, project
H is accepted with probability IL =IH , also giving the manager an expected
utility of IL(). These acceptance probabilities induce the manager
to reveal project L when it is available. Note that the positive rejection
246

Why the NPV Criterion does not Maximize NPV

probability of project H requires headquarters to commit to an action that
is ex post inefficient. Headquarters can be held to this commitment both
indirectly and directly. First, if headquarters keeps deviating from this
rule, it will lose its reputation and thus its ability to induce managers to
reveal the best project. Second, shareholders may provide members of the
board of directors with compensation packages that internalize the optimal rule. Since negotiation of the board of directors' compensation before
the decision on every project is practically impossible, this may induce the
implementation of the optimal capital budgeting rule.14
Proposition 1(a)(ii) describes the situation where it is more efficient for
headquarters to induce the manager to reveal project L by paying her the difference in her utility from accepting project L over project H, W(LH, ) 
 (IHÿIL). Finally, Proposition 1(b)(ii) describes the situation where
delegating project selection to the manager dominates direct intervention
in the capital budgeting or giving incentives to the manager by paying her
to reveal the availability of project L. The reason for this is that when > 1,
paying the manager her difference in utility from undertaking project L
over project H is higher than the difference in the projects' NPV.
2 Capital Budgeting Criteria and the Implementation of the
Optimal Outcome


We now analyze the effectiveness of various well-known capital budgeting
criteria in implementing the outcome of the optimal capital allocation
system defined in Proposition 1. In particular, we compare the effectiveness of ratio criteria like IRR and PI to level criteria like NPV in implementing the optimal capital budgeting rule. However, before comparing
the criteria, it is necessary to define the relationship between a capital
allocation system and capital budgeting criteria. To define this relationship, we view capital budgeting criteria as a mechanism to implement the
optimal capital budgeting rule specified in Proposition 1.
An important aspect of the implementation of a capital budgeting
rule is how the headquarters' project selection process is communicated to
divisional managers. If this process is not communicated in a clear and understandable manner, managers will not be certain of the consequences of project
manipulation. Thus the capital allocation system will not reduce manager
manipulations of project information as it could. Our premise is that capital
budgeting criteria are instrumental to communicate headquarters' decision
processes to divisional managers in a clear and understandable manner.
In most corporations, the capital budgeting rule is communicated formally via a capital budgeting manual that gives instructions on how to file
14

If it is impossible to implement a stochastic capital budgeting rule, the optimal rule will be similar, with
acceptance probabilities restricted to either one or zero.

247

The Review of Financial Studies / v 17 n 1 2004

a request and what to include [see Segelod (1995)]. The capital budgeting
criteria are one method to specify the capital budgeting rules. However,
these criteria are often overly simplistic and thus should be dominated by
more detailed, accurate capital budgeting rules. Thus we might ask why
firms prefer the simple criteria to their more effective underlying counterparts. In the context of the current model, this question may be rephrased
as, why should firms prefer to use simple capital budgeting criteria that are
independent of the scale parameter  over more detailed capital budgeting
rules that depend on the scale parameter ?
However, the very simplicity of these capital budgeting criteria may
provide a communication advantage. Since a firm's capital budgeting
manual may be complex and cumbersome, any simplification may enhance
its communication value. Therefore we view the optimal capital budgeting
criterion as the one that best communicates headquarters' capital budgeting rules. In this respect, the trade-off in selecting a capital budgeting
criterion is between simplicity (the cost of complexity) and precision.
Given this trade-off, we now explore the efficiency of typical capital
budgeting criteria in implementing the optimal system specified in
Proposition 1. This analysis shows that some simple capital budgeting
criteria, like the IRR and PI, can implement the outcome of the optimal
system, while others, like the NPV rule, cannot.
To evaluate these criteria, we must first derive a definition of criterion complexity. A natural measure of complexity in our model is . In
general, the optimal system depends on . This dependence creates
complexity because both headquarters and the manager must perform
the following two steps to implement a capital allocation system that
depends on :
1.
2.

Indicate to the manager how headquarters defines and calculates .
Specify the set of contingencies, as prescribed by Proposition 1, on
the calculated .

Note that if a criterion is independent of , headquarters does not need to
specify these steps. Following this observation, we define two degrees of
complexity: simple criteria, or criteria that are not conditioned on , and
complex criteria, or criteria that are conditioned on .
Given the above measure of criterion complexity, we now explore
specific capital budgeting criteria. We first examine the capital budgeting
criteria as defined by typical finance texts. We next assess the effectiveness
of the textbook versions and offer modified versions of these criteria. We
then assess the effectiveness of the modified versions in implementing the
optimal capital budgeting rule.
We focus our analysis on the most common capital budgeting criteriaÐ
NPV, IRR, and PI. The textbook NPV rule is to undertake the highest
positive-NPV project. Similarly the textbook IRR rule is to accept the
248

We now show that the above criteria, in their textbook forms, cannot
implement the best outcome. We first examine the effectiveness of the
NPV rule where headquarters accepts the project with the highest positive
NPV. The manager will take advantage of this rule by requesting project
H whenever it is available. Since the NPV of project H is positive, and it is
the only one that the manager requests, headquarters will accept it, leading to an inferior outcome.16 For the same reason, the textbook IRR
and PI ratio also fail to implement the best outcome. This discussion is
summarized in the following proposition.
Proposition 2.
outcome.

The textbook NPV, IRR, and PI cannot implement the best

We now examine whether simple modified versions of the above criteria
can implement a better outcome by imposing stricter project acceptance
standards. For example, headquarters can use a simple modified NPV
criterion that specifies a critical value, NPVc, such that a project is
accepted with probability 1 if its NPV is above NPVc. If the requested
project's NPV is lower than NPVc, the project is accepted with the optimal
probability, . However, this modification creates the following two
deviations from the outcome of Proposition 1. First, for projects with
high  values, the manager can manipulate headquarters to approve
project H. This occurs when NPV H() > NPVc. Second, when  is low,
good projects will be rejected. This occurs when NPV L() < NPVc.
Thus the simple modified NPV rule is effective only when
NPV H()  NPVc  NPV L(), in which case, the manager requests only
15

In the following discussion, we assume that the IRRs of projects are well defined and unique. When this
assumption is violated, the IRR rule cannot implement the optimal mechanism.

16

When there are more than two alternative projects, the manager may include other available projects in

A simple modified NPV criterion cannot implement the best

We now examine the effectiveness of modifications of the IRR and PI
criteria. Of interest is that although a simple modified NPV rule cannot
implement the outcome of the optimal capital budgeting rule, simple
modified versions of the IRR and PI rules can implement the outcome
specified in Proposition 1(a)(i) and Proposition 1(b)(i). Proposition 4
shows how a simple modified IRR criterion implements this outcome.18
Proposition 4. Suppose the conditions of either Proposition 1(a)(i) or
Proposition 1(b)(i) hold. Then headquarters can implement the optimal outcome of the capital budgeting process through the following rules. If the
capital budgeting request includes one project, a project with IRR  IRRL is
accepted with probability 1, while a project with IRR  IRRH is accepted
with probability H  IL =IH . If it includes two projects, the project with
IRR  IRRL is accepted. The wage is set at W  0.
Proposition 4 shows scenarios in which simple modified IRR and PI
criteria can be used to implement the best capital budgeting outcome when
a simple modified NPV criterion cannot.19 The generality of the example
we analyze here is important to the conclusions we can draw from the
analysis. How general are these scenarios? Can this example explain why
the IRR criterion is widely used in practice? We have used a constant
return to scale example to show two properties simultaneously. First, that
the IRR and PI criteria dominate the NPV criterion, and second, that both
can implement the best outcome. We believe that the first property,

Another possible way to curb managers is by imposing capital rationing. Since a manager will prefer
large-scale projects, capital rationing may force her to report the lower investment project. Specifically,
by imposing capital rationing, headquarters establishes a critical capital limit, I c, such that, if the
requested capital is below Ic, the request is approved, and if the requested capital is above I c, the project
is accepted with the optimal probability, . However, capital rationing creates the same inefficiencies as
the modified NPV criterion: when IL() > I c, good projects are rejected, and when IH() < I c, the
manager can manipulate headquarters to accept project H. Thus capital rationing does not implement
the best outcome.

18

To focus on capital budgeting criteria, Proposition 4 does not discuss the implementation of the optimal
outcome specified in Propositions 1(a)(ii) and 1(b)(ii). To implement the outcome of Proposition 1(a)(ii),
headquarters pays the manager a wage of  (IHÿIL), accepts the requested project if the manager
requests one project, and accepts the project with IRRL if the capital budgeting request includes both
projects. To implement the outcome of Proposition 1(b)(ii), headquarters delegates the capital budgeting
decision to the manager.

19

The case of a simple modified PI yields similar outcomes, with PI replacing IRR in the cases outlined in
Proposition 4.

Why the NPV Criterion does not Maximize NPV

namely, the dominance of the IRR and PI over the NPV criterion, applies
to many situations.20 This dominance, however, does not imply that the
IRR and PI criteria are part of firms' optimal capital allocation systems.
Thus, to conclude that our theory explains why so many firms use the IRR
and PI criteria requires that they implement the best outcome in many
different scenarios. How plausible is this condition?
To answer this question it is important to look at the sensitivity of our
results to changing the constant return to scale assumption, in which case
both the investment level and future cash flow will be affected by market
factors, but at a different rate. For example, both the levels of investment
and future cash flow will move up with a positive demand shock, but the
impact on future cash flow is likely to be stronger. We can capture it in our
model by having different 's multiply c and I, where the one that multiplies c is higher. As a result, the NPV, IRR, and PI all increase in .
However, the IRR and PI, being ratios, are less sensitive to changes in 
than the NPV. Moreover, it is possible that if the difference in the underlying technologies is big enough, the highest IRR for all possible 's under
the inferior technology (H) is lower than that under the superior one (L).
In this case, the capital budgeting system of Proposition 4 applies. Even
when such a ``clean'' separation is not feasible, the IRR and PI, both being
less sensitive to demand shocks and simple, may be optimal over
more complex rules. However, it is plausible that in other situations,
more complex rules are optimal. In this respect, our theory may reconcile
research findings on the actual use of capital budgeting criteria within
organizations that most corporations do not rely solely on the NPV rule
and use multiple capital budgeting criteria in their practice of capital
budgeting. See, for example, Segelod (1995).
3 Conclusion


Our theory of capital allocation shows that there are plausible scenarios
where the well-known and often criticized capital budgeting criteria like
IRR and PI will perform better than the NPV criterion in implementing a
value-maximizing project selection process. The main contribution of this
theory is the idea that although the NPV is the right statistic to measure
the value added to a firm from undertaking a certain project, it often does
a poor job in implementing a selection process that maximizes firm value.
Consequently NPV, although a useful valuation tool, is ineffective as the
core of a capital allocation process. Our theory is consistent with evidence
that many companies do not use the NPV criterion at all in their capital
allocation process, or only rely on it partially.
20

However, it is possible that under some other scenarios, with different information structure and
incentives, the NPV criterion does better than the IRR and PI criteria.

251

The Review of Financial Studies / v 17 n 1 2004

An important explanation derived from our theory is why firms may
use modified versions of textbook budgeting criteria. For example, some
firms may use a modified NPV criterion, where they accept projects only if
the NPV is above a threshold level different from zero. Or they may use a
modified PI criterion, where they set the cutoff for accepting projects at a
PI level different than one. Finally, they may employ a modified IRR rule,
where the hurdle rate is different than the cost of capital. Our theory
shows how all of these modifications are attempts to implement the
optimal project selection process. Given this expanded understanding of
the rationale behind capital budgeting criteria choices, our theory can
explain the puzzling finding in Poterba and Summers (1995) that U.S.
firms use real hurdle rates that are considerably higher than standard
cost-of-capital analysis would suggest. Similarly, to the extent that multinational firms investing abroad confront more severe implementation
problems, our theory provides a possible rationale for the often-criticized
practice of adding a fudge factor to their cost of capital.
In sum, our analysis shows that the capital allocation process is more
complicated than is traditionally taught, and that seemingly irrational
budgeting practices may have a logical rationale behind them. This analysis also makes the point that market imperfections play a role in firms'
capital allocation processes. Since firms operate in imperfect capital markets, it should not be surprising that firms don't rely on the NPV rule, just
as it is not surprising that firms care about their capital structure when
markets are imperfect.

We first check for possible solutions that satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of Equations
(15)±(23) when W > 0, and then check for possible solutions when W  0.
We first suppose that W > 0. In this case it follows that the bracketed expression in
Equation (15) equals zero. Similarly we know from Equation (23) that 6  0. Substituting
zero for the above two components in Equation (15) yields 1  gL gH > 0. Consequently the
bracketed expression in Equation (18) equals zero, implying that

We now show that L  1. Suppose instead that L  0. Under this supposition, Equation
(24) implies that W  [(Hÿ1) IH()]  0, a contradiction. Thus L > 0. It follows from this
that the bracketed expression in Equation (16) equals zero. Furthermore, we know that
Equation (20) implies that 3  0. We can now substitute 1  gL gH and 3  0 into the
bracketed expression in Equation (16). Since we know that the bracketed expression in
Equation (16) equals zero, we obtain
2  gL gH IH  ÿ IL 1 ÿ  6 0:

25

From Equations (25) and (19), it follows that L  1.
Similarly, to show that H  1, we suppose instead that H  0. Under this supposition,
and since L  1, Equation (24) implies that W [ÿ IL()] < 0, a contradiction. Thus H > 0.
It follows from this that the bracketed expression in Equation (17) equals zero. Furthermore,
Equation (22) implies that 5  0. We can now substitute 1  gL gH and 5  0 into the
bracketed expression in Equation (17). Since we know that the bracketed expression in
Equation (17) equals zero, we obtain:
1 ÿ gL gH NPVH  ÿ gL gH IH   4 :

26

It follows from Equation (26) that 4 6 0, except, possibly, for one special case. Since 4 6 0,
Equation (21) implies that H  1.
We can now substitute L  H  1 into Equation (24) to obtain W  [ IH()ÿ IL()].
Thus the resulting expected value to shareholders, when W > 0, is

We now check for possible solutions to the problem when W  0. In this proof there are five
mutually exclusive and fully exhaustive cases to consider in the search for a solution to

H  L  1
H  1 and L < 1
H < 1 and L  1.

We first examine case 1. Evaluation of case 1 shows that it cannot be a solution to the
problem because increasing H from zero to one increases the objective function of Equation
(10), while Equations (11)±(14) continue to hold.
Likewise, we find that case 2 cannot be a solution to the problem. Under the assumptions
of case 2, Equations (19)±(22) imply that 2  3  4  5  0. However, substituting
2  3  4  5  0 into the bracketed expression in Equations (16) and (17) (note that
these expressions equal zero) yields conflicting solutions for 1. Thus the system of equations
does not hold for case 2.
In addition, we find that case 3 cannot be a solution to the problem. In this case, the incentive
compatibility constraint of Equation (11) is violated.
We now consider case 4. This case presents a possible solution to the problem. The
suppositions that W  0 and H  1, and the incentive compatibility constraint of Equation
(11), imply that L  0. The resulting expected value to shareholders is
Vc4   gL 1 ÿ gH NPVL   gH NPVH :

28

Finally, we consider case 5. This case also presents a possible solution to the problem. To
evaluate case 5, we first show that H > 0. If H  0, then the incentive compatibility
constraint of Equation (11) holds as a strict inequality, implying that the objective function
can be increased by increasing H without violating the constraint. Thus H > 0. It follows
from this that the bracketed expression in Equation (17) equals zero. We further know that
Equation (22) implies that 5  0. Similarly, since H < 1, Equation (21) implies that 4  0.
Substituting 4  5  0 into Equation (17) yields 1 > 0. Consequently the bracketed expression in Equation (18) must equal zero. Substituting L  1 into Equation (18) and equating
the bracketed expression to zero yields H  IL =IH . Thus the resulting expected value to
shareholders is

IH
To prove Proposition 1(a), suppose that < 1. We now use Equations (27)±(29) to fully
characterize the optimal solution for the optimization problem.
A comparison of Equations (27) and (28) yields that Vc4 < Vw iff gLgH(IH()ÿ
IL())(1ÿ ) > 0. Since < 1 and IH() > IL(), this inequality holds for all parameter values,
implying that Vc4 < Vw. Thus it remains to compare Vw to Vc5 of Equation (29). Using
Equations (27) and (29), we find that Vc5 > Vw iff:
gL  gL 

Therefore, for gL  gL , the optimal solution is W  0, L  1, and H  IL =IH . This proves
Proposition 1(a)(1). For gL < gL , the optimal solution is W   (IHÿIL)), L  H  1. This
proves Proposition 1(a)(ii).
To prove Proposition 1(b), suppose that > 1. We know from comparing Equations (27)±
(28) that Vc4 > Vw. Thus it remains to compare Vc4 of Equation (28) to Vc5 of Equation (29).
Comparing these equations we find that Vc5 > Vc4 iff:

proves Proposition 1(b)(i). For gL < gL , the optimal solution is W  0, L  0, and H  1.
This proves Proposition 1(b)(ii).
