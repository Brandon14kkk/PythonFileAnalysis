ABSTRACT
This paper outlines and tests two agency models of dividends. According to the
"outcomemodel," dividends are paid because minority shareholders pressure corporate insiders to disgorge cash. According to the "substitute model," insiders interested in issuing equity in the future pay dividends to establish a reputation for
decent treatment of minority shareholders. The first model predicts that stronger
minority shareholder rights should be associated with higher dividend payouts;
the second model predicts the opposite. Tests on a cross section of 4,000 companies
from 33 countries with different levels of minority shareholder rights support the
outcome agency model of dividends.

THE SO-CALLEDDIVIDEND PUZZLE (Black (1976)) has preoccupied the attention of
financial economists at least since Modigliani and Miller's seminal work (see
Modigliani and Miller (1958) and Miller and Modigliani (1961)). This work
established that, in a frictionless world, when the investment policy of a
firm is held constant, its dividend payout policy has no consequences for
shareholder wealth. Higher dividend payouts lead to lower retained earnings and capital gains, and vice versa, leaving total wealth of the shareholders unchanged. Contrary to this prediction, however, corporations follow
extremely deliberate dividend payout strategies (Lintner (1956)). This evidence raises a puzzle: How do firms choose their dividend policies?
In the United States and other countries, the puzzle is even deeper since
many shareholders are taxed more heavily on their dividend receipts than
on capital gains. The actual magnitude of this tax burden is debated (see
Poterba and Summers (1985) and Allen and Michaely (1997)), but taxes generally make it even harder to explain dividend policies of firms.
Economists have proposed a number of explanations of the dividend puzzle. Of these, particularly popular is the idea that firms can signal future
profitability by paying dividends (see Bhattacharya (1979), John and Wil-

liams (1985), Miller and Rock (1985), and Ambarish, John, and Williams
(1987)). Empirically, this theory had considerable initial success, since firms
that initiate (or raise) dividends experience share price increases, and the
converse is true for firms that eliminate (or cut) dividends (Aharony and
Swary (1980), Asquith and Mullins (1983)). Recent results are more mixed,
since current dividend changes do not help predict firms' future earnings
growth (DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Skinner (1996) and Benartzi, Michaely,
and Thaler (1997)).
Another idea, which has received only limited attention until recently (e.g.,
Easterbrook (1984), Jensen (1986), Fluck (1998, 1999), Hart and Moore (1974),
Myers (1998), Gomes (2000), and Zwiebel (1996)), is that dividend policies
address agency problems between corporate insiders and outside shareholders. According to these theories, unless profits are paid out to shareholders,
they may be diverted by the insiders for personal use or committed to unprofitable projects that provide private benefits for the insiders. As a consequence, outside shareholders have a preference for dividends over retained
earnings. Theories differ on how outside shareholders actually get firms to
disgorge cash. The key point, however, is that failure to disgorge cash leads
to its diversion or waste, which is detrimental to outside shareholders' interest.
The agency approach moves away from the assumptions of the ModiglianiMiller theorem by recognizing two points. First, the investment policy of
the firm cannot be taken as independent of its dividend policy, and, in particular, paying out dividends may reduce the inefficiency of marginal investments. Second, and more subtly, the allocation of all the profits of the
firm to shareholders on a pro rata basis cannot be taken for granted, and
in particular the insiders may get preferential treatment through asset
holding the investment policy
diversion, transfer prices, and theft-even
constant. Insofar as dividends are paid on a pro rata basis, they benefit
outside shareholders relative to the alternative of expropriation of retained
earnings.
In this paper, we attempt to identify some of the basic elements of the
agency approach to dividends, to understand its key implications, and to
evaluate them on a cross section of more than 4,000 firms from 33 countries
around the world. The reason for looking around the world is that the severity of agency problems to which minority shareholders are exposed differs
greatly across countries, in part because legal protection of these shareholders varies (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997, 1998),
henceforth referred to as LLSV). Empirically, we find that dividend policies
vary across legal regimes in ways consistent with a particular version of the
agency theory of dividends. Specifically, firms in common law countries, where
investor protection is typically better, make higher dividend payouts than
firms in civil law countries do. Moreover, in common but not civil law countries, high growth firms make lower dividend payouts than low growth firms.
These results support the version of the agency theory in which investors in
good legal protection countries use their legal powers to extract dividends
from firms, especially when reinvestment opportunities are poor.

Section I of the paper summarizes some of the theoretical arguments. Section II describes the data. Section III presents our empirical findings. Section IV concludes.

I. Theoretical Issues
A. Agency Problems and Legal Regimes
Conflicts of interest between corporate insiders, such as managers and
controlling shareholders, on the one hand, and outside investors, such as
minority shareholders, on the other hand, are central to the analysis of the
modern corporation (Berle and Means (1932), Jensen and Meckling (1976)).
The insiders who control corporate assets can use these assets for a range of
purposes that are detrimental to the interests of the outside investors. Most
simply, they can divert corporate assets to themselves, through outright theft,
dilution of outside investors through share issues to the insiders, excessive
salaries, asset sales to themselves or other corporations they control at favorable prices, or transfer pricing with other entities they control (see Shleifer and Vishny (1997) for a discussion). Alternatively, insiders can use corporate
assets to pursue investment strategies that yield them personal benefits of
control, such as growth or diversification, without benefiting outside investors (e.g., Baumol (1959), Jensen (1986)).
What is meant by insiders varies from country to country. In the United
States, the U.K., Canada, and Australia, where ownership in large corporations is relatively dispersed, most large corporations are to a significant
extent controlled by their managers. In most other countries, large firms
typically have shareholders that own a significant fraction of equity, such as
the founding families (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999)). The
controlling shareholders can effectively determine the decisions of the managers (indeed, managers typically come from the controlling family), and
hence the problem of managerial control per se is not as severe as it is in the
rich common law countries. On the other hand, the controlling shareholders
can implement policies that benefit themselves at the expense of minority
shareholders. Regardless of the identity of the insiders, the victims of insider control are minority shareholders. It is these minority shareholders
who would typically have a taste for dividends.
One of the principal remedies to agency problems is the law. Corporate
and other law gives outside investors, including shareholders, certain powers to protect their investment against expropriation by insiders. These powers in the case of shareholders range from the right to receive the same per
share dividends as the insiders, to the right to vote on important corporate
matters, including the election of directors, to the right to sue the company
for damages. The very fact that this legal protection exists probably explains
why becoming a minority shareholder is a viable investment strategy, as
opposed to just being an outright giveaway of money to strangers who are
under few if any obligations to give it back.

As pointed out by LLSV (1998), the extent of legal protection of outside
investors differs enormously across countries. Legal protection consists of
both the content of the laws and the quality of their enforcement. Some
countries, including most notably the wealthy common law countries such as
the United States and the U.K., provide effective protection of minority shareholders so that the outright expropriation of corporate assets by the insiders
is rare. Agency problems manifest themselves primarily through non-valuemaximizing investment choices. In many other countries, the condition of
outside investors is a good deal more precarious, but even there some protection does exist. LLSV (1998) show in particular that common law countries appear to have the best legal protection of minority shareholders, whereas
civil law countries, and most conspicuously the French civil law countries,
have the weakest protection.
The quality of investor protection, viewed as a proxy for lower agency
costs, has been shown to matter for a number of important issues in corporate finance. For example, corporate ownership is more concentrated in countries with inferior shareholder protection (LLSV (1998), La Porta, Lopez-deSilanes, and Shleifer (1999)). The valuation and breadth of capital markets
is greater in countries with better investor protection (LLSV (1997), DemirgucKunt and Maksimovic (1998)). Finally, there is some evidence that good investor protection contributes to the efficiency of resource allocation and to
economic growth more generally (Levine and Zervos (1998), Rajan and Zingales (1995)). This paper continues this research by examining the dividend
puzzle using shareholder protection as a proxy for agency problems.
B. Agency and Dividends: Two Views
B. 1. The Role of Dividends in an Agency Context
In a world of significant agency problems between corporate insiders and
outsiders, dividends can play a useful role. By paying dividends, insiders
return corporate earnings to investors and hence are no longer capable of
using these earnings to benefit themselves. Dividends (a bird in the hand)
are better than retained earnings (a bird in the bush) because the latter
might never materialize as future dividends (can fly away). Additionally, the
payment of dividends exposes companies to the possible need to come to the
capital markets in the future to raise external funds, and hence gives outside investors an opportunity to exercise some control over the insiders at
that time (Easterbrook (1984)).
Unfortunately, there are no fully satisfactory theoretical agency models
of dividends that derive dividend policies as part of some broad optimal
contract between investors and corporate insiders, which allows for a range
of feasible financing instruments. Instead, different models, such as Fluck
(1998, 1999), Myers (1998), and Gomes (2000), capture different aspects of
the problem. Moreover, the existing agency models do not fully deal with the
issues of choice between debt and equity in addressing agency problems, the

Agency Problems and Dividend Policies

choice between dividends and share repurchases, and the relationship between dividends and new share issues. We attempt to distill from the available literature the basic mechanisms of how dividends could be used to deal
with agency problems. In particular, we distinguish between two very different agency "models" of dividends. The predictions of these models that we
test are necessarily limited by the fact that we do not look at all the financing and payout choices simultaneously.
Perhaps most importantly in this regard, we do not examine share repurchases, which have been commonly taken as an alternative to paying dividends. We note, however, that share repurchases are most common precisely
in the countries where firms pay high dividends, such as the United States
and the U.K. For example, between June 1997 and June 1998 there were
1,537 share repurchases in the world recorded by the Securities Data Corporation, of which 1,100 occurred in the United States. By market value, the
United States accounted for 72 percent of world share repurchases during
this period, and the United States, the U.K., Canada, and Australia combined accounted for 83 percent. In some civil law countries, share repurchases are even illegal or heavily taxed (The Economist, August 15, 1998).1
If share repurchases are complementary to dividends, rather than a substitute for them, our evidence only underestimates the difference in total cash
payouts to shareholders between civil and common law countries.
B.2. Dividends as an Outcome of Legal Protection of Shareholders
Under the first view, dividends are an outcome of an effective system of
legal protection of shareholders. Under an effective system, minority shareholders use their legal powers to force companies to disgorge cash, thus precluding insiders from using too high a fraction of company earnings to benefit
themselves.2 Shareholders might do so by voting for directors who offer better dividend policies, by selling shares to potential hostile raiders who then
gain control over non-dividend paying companies, or by suing companies
that spend too lavishly on activities that benefit only the insiders. Moreover,
good investor protection makes asset diversion legally riskier and more expensive for the insiders, thereby raising the relative attraction of dividends
for them. The greater the rights of the minority shareholders, the more cash
they extract from the company, other things equal.
It is important to recognize that this argument does not rely on minority
shareholders having specific rights to dividends per se, but rather on their
having the more general rights of voting for directors and protesting wealth
1 It could be argued that the discouragement of share repurchases is a form of shareholder
protection since, unlike dividends, share repurchases can be discriminatory. This argument is
less plausible in light of the fact that most share repurchases in the United States and the U.K.
are open market, and, moreover, appear to supplement rather than substitute for dividends.
2 Even under an effective system, residual agency problems must remain, for if they are
totally resolved, we are back to the world of Modigliani and Miller with no reason for dividends.

expropriation. A good example from the United States is Kirk Kerkorian
forcing Chrysler Corporation to disgorge its cash by paying dividends in
1995 to 1996. As a large shareholder in Chrysler, Kerkorian had no specific
rights to dividends, but used the voting mechanism to put his associates on
the board and then force the board to sharply raise dividends. Another good
example is Velcro Industries, the producer of the famous "touch fastener"
incorporated on the island of Curacao in the Netherlands Antilles, "where
shareholders have no right of dissent" (Forbes, October 15, 1990). Two-thirds
of the shares of Velcro Industries are controlled by the Cripps family that
runs Velcro (Forbes, May 23, 1994). In 1988, despite having a large cash
reserve, the company suspended dividends "for the foreseeable future" (Forbes,
October 3, 1988), -delisted itself from the Montreal Stock Exchange, and aggressively wrote down assets to slash earnings, evidently to "buy out Velcro
minority holders cheap" (Forbes, May 23, 1994). The share price dived and,
in 1990, with dividends remaining at zero, the Crippses offered to repurchase minority shares at slightly above the market price. Minority shareholders sued in New York and "when a New York judge ruled that the United
States was the proper jurisdiction, secretive Sir Humphrey Cripps decided
to call off his offer rather than go under the light of U.S. court of law"
(Forbes, May 23, 1994). The company subsequently resumed its dividend
payments. This case illustrates that, in a high protection country like the
United States, in contrast to a low protection country like the Netherlands,
shareholders are able to extract dividends from companies by virtue of their
ability to resist oppression rather than having any specific dividend rights
per se.
In a cross section of countries with different quality of shareholder protection, the implication that better protection is associated with higher dividend payouts is testable. There is one further implication of this theory.
Consider a country with good shareholder protection, and compare two companies in that country: one with good investment opportunities and growth
prospects, and another with poor opportunities. Shareholders who feel protected would accept low dividend payouts, and high reinvestment rates, from
a company with good opportunities because they know that when this company's investments pay off, they could extract high dividends. In contrast, a
mature company with poor investment opportunities would not be allowed
to invest unprofitably. As a consequence, with good shareholder protection,
high growth companies should have significantly lower dividend payouts
than low growth companies. In contrast, if shareholder protection is poor, we
would not necessarily expect such a relationship between payouts and growth
since shareholders may try to get what they can-which may not be muchimmediately. This also is a testable implication.3 The implications of the
outcome agency model of dividends are illustrated in Figure 1.
3 Ambarish et al. (1987) derive the negative relationship between growth and payouts in a
dividend signaling model. They do not focus on how this relationship would vary depending on
how well shareholders are protected. In principle, this extension is possible.

model of dividends.

B.3. Dividends as a Substitute for Legal Protection of Shareholders
In an alternative agency view, dividends are a substitute for legal protection.4 This view relies crucially on the need for firms to come to the external
capital markets for funds, at least occasionally. To be able to raise external
funds on attractive terms, a firm must establish a reputation for moderation
in expropriating shareholders. One way to establish such a reputation is by
paying dividends, which reduces what is left for expropriation. For this mechanism to work, the firm must never want to "cash in" its reputation by
stopping dividends and expropriating shareholders entirely. The firm would
never want to cash in if, for example, there is enough uncertainty about its
future cash flows that the option of going back to the capital market is
always valuable (Bulow and Rogoff (1989)).
A reputation for good treatment of shareholders is worth the most in countries with weak legal protection of minority shareholders, who have little
else to rely on. As a consequence, the need for dividends to establish a reputation is the greatest in such countries. In countries with stronger shareholder protection, in contrast, the need for a reputational mechanism is weaker,
and hence so is the need to pay dividends. This view implies that, other
things equal, dividend payout ratios should be higher in countries with weak
legal protection of shareholders than in those with strong protection.5
4 The closest informal discussion to the substitute model is Easterbrook (1984). Formally, the
model that comes the closest to taking this point of view is Gomes (2000). However, the recent
drafts of his paper have moved away from focusing on dividends, and hence our discussion
should not be interpreted as a description of Gomes's model.
' Dewenter and Warther (1998) argue that there is less need to signal future earnings with
dividends in Japan than in the United States. This may be because Japanese firms have better
ways of information transmission to the relevant investors than do U.S. firms, or because Japanese managers are more insulated from investor pressure (Kang and Stulz (1996)). Dewenter
and Warther find that share price reactions to dividend changes are smaller in Japan than in
the United States. This finding may be consistent with either of the two agency models of
dividends.

Figure 2. Substitute model of dividends.

Additionally, in this view, firms with better growth prospects also have a
stronger incentive to establish a reputation since they have a greater potential need for external finance, other things equal. As a result, firms with
better growth prospects might choose higher dividend payout ratios than
firms with poor growth prospects. However, firms with good growth prospects also have a better current use of funds than firms with poor growth
prospects. The relationship between growth prospects and dividend payout
ratios is therefore ambiguous. Figure 2 illustrates the implications of this
substitute agency model of dividends.
B.4. Summary of Predictions of Agency Models
We refer to the two alternative agency models of dividends as "the outcome model" and "the substitute model." The outcome model predicts that
dividend payout ratios are higher in countries with good shareholder protection, other things equal. The substitute model predicts the opposite. The
outcome model further predicts that, in countries with good shareholder protection, companies with better investment opportunities should have lower
dividend payout ratios. The substitute model does not make this prediction.
In fact, it makes a weak prediction that, in countries with poor shareholder
protection, firms with better investment opportunities might pay out more
to maintain reputations.
C. Tax Issues
Economists are divided on the effects of taxes on the valuation of dividends
(Poterba and Summers (1985)). The so-called traditional view holds that heavy
least in
taxation of dividends at both the corporate and personal levels-at
the United States-is a strong deterrent to paying out dividends rather than
retaining the earnings. There are two important objections to this view. One
objection, raised by Miller and Scholes (1978), states that investors have

Agency Problems and Dividend Policies

9

access to a variety of dividend tax avoidance strategies that allow them to
effectively escape dividend taxes. This objection does not closely correspond
to what investors actually do (Feenberg (1981)). Another objection, the socalled new view of dividends and taxes (e.g., King (1977), Auerbach (1979)),
holds that cash has to be paid out as dividends sooner or later, and therefore
paying it earlier in the form of current dividends imposes no greater a tax
burden on shareholders than does the delay. According to this theory, taxes
do not deter dividend payments. Harris, Hubbard, and Kemsley (1997) support this new view. In our empirical work, we include a measure of the tax
disadvantage of dividends based on Poterba and Summers (1984, 1985) to
assess the effect of taxes on dividend policies. Appendix A summarizes in
detail our treatment of the tax effects of dividends, and also presents the
data on taxes that we use in the empirical work.
II. Data
Our sample is based on the March 1996 edition of the WorldScope Database, which presents information on the (typically) largest listed firms in 46
countries. There are 13,698 firms in the original database. Since accounting
data are often reported with a delay, our analysis uses data through 1994.
Table I, Panel A summarizes the construction of the sample. From the original universe, we eliminate firms trading in socialist countries and in Luxembourg; firms listed in countries with mandatory dividend policies (i.e.,
legal requirements that a certain fraction of net income is paid out as dividends); financial firms; firms completely or partially owned by the government (as best we can identify them); firms without consolidated balance
sheets in 1989, 1994, or both; firms with negative net income or negative
cash flow in 1994; firms with missing dividend data in 1994 or missing
sales, net income, or cash flow data in 1994 or 1989; firms whose dividends
exceed sales; and finally, three firms that do not appear to be publicly traded.
This leaves us with the basic sample of 4,103 firms from 33 countries for
which we can compute dividend payout ratios in 1994 and sales growth rates
from 1989 to 1994. Panel B shows how we get from 46 to 33 countries.
We note in particular the exclusion of countries with mandatory dividend
rules, namely Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Greece, and Venezuela.6 Some of these
countries have weak legal protection of minority shareholders. The fact that,
in such environments, regulators choose to force companies to pay dividends
is in itself some evidence in favor of the importance of agency considerations, since the most plausible reason for a mandatory dividend policy is to
assure outside investors that they would not be expropriated entirely, and
thus to encourage participation in the equity markets by such investors (LLSV
(1998)). In general, firms in mandatory dividend countries have higher pay6

There also appears to be a minimum dividend requirement in Germany, although it can be
waived at the discretion of management. Because this requirement is so weak, we do not count
Germany as a mandatory-dividend country. Excluding it would only strengthen our results.

outs than firms in countries without such rules, but they nevertheless appear, in the data, to have lower payouts than required by the law. A possible
reason for this is that the accounting earnings reported to the authorities for
the purposes of compliance with mandatory dividend rules are lower than the
earnings reported to the shareholders which we use in our analysis.
Table II summarizes the construction of the variables. We use two rough proxies for protection of minority shareholders. The first is a dummy equal to one
if a country's company law or commercial code is of civil origin, and zero for
common law origin. Because we have data on few countries, we do not distinguish between French, German, and Scandinavian civil law origins in this paper, as in LLSV (1997, 1998). In general, civil law countries have weaker legal
protection of minority shareholders than do common law countries. The second measure of investor protection, the low investor protection dummy, is equal
to one if the index of antidirector rights is below the sample median. The index
of antidirector rights comes from LLSV (1998), and reflects such aspects of minority rights as the ease of voting for directors, the possibility of electing directors through a cumulative voting mechanism, the existence of a grievance
mechanism for oppressed minority shareholders, such as a class action lawsuit, the percentage of votes needed to call an extraordinary shareholder meeting, and the existence of preemptive rights.

Agency Problems and Dividend Policies

Since we are dealing with accounting data in countries with different
accounting standards, we compute several measures of the dividend payout
ratio. The numerator in these ratios is the total cash dividend paid to
common and preferred shareholders. The denominators are cash flow, earnings, and sales. The dividend-to-cash-flow ratio has a natural economic
interpretation since it is the ratio of cash distributed to cash generated in
a period. The dividend-to-earnings ratio is the most commonly used measure of dividend payouts. The two ratios have several problems, however.
First, both of them may depend on a country's accounting conventions, and
hence may not be exactly comparable across countries. Second, these ratios
have the potential problem of being easily manipulated by accounting tricks.
Third, and perhaps most important, diversion of resources may occur before earnings or cash flows are reported, in which case these two ratios
overestimate the share of true earnings that is paid out as dividends. Fortunately, if diversion is greater in countries with poor shareholder protection, this problem biases the results toward finding higher payouts in these
countries than is really the case. Our results of lower measured payouts in
countries with poor shareholder protection reported below would thus be
even stronger if true earnings and cash flows were higher than reported.
Still, as an additional guard against these problems, we also present the
dividends-to-sales ratio, since sales are less dependent on accounting conventions, are harder to manipulate or smooth through accounting practices, and are less subject to theft. Sales should be viewed just as a deflator;
the economic interpretation of this ratio is not transparent.
The trickiest measurement problem we face is how to capture investment
opportunities across firms in a way that is consistent across countries. Our
principal measure of such opportunities is the past growth in sales of each
firm, which has the advantage of being roughly independent of accounting
practices, but has the disadvantage of relying on the past as a proxy for the
future. For each firm, we compute its annual real sales growth rate over the
five-year period from 1989 to 1994. In Section III, we discuss other measures of investment opportunities.
For our dividend payout ratios and the sales growth rate, we also compute
industry-adjusted measures. For each company in a given industry, we make
this adjustment relative to the worldwide rather than countrywide measure
for that industry (i.e., we take out worldwide industry effects rather than
country-industry effects). Consider the computation of the industry-adjusted
growth in sales, for example. We first find for each industry in each country
the median real growth rate of sales in that industry in that country. We
then take the median of country medians, thus obtaining the worldwide median growth in real sales in the industry. Our measure of industry-adjusted
growth in sales for a company is the difference between that company's sales
growth and the world median sales growth in its industry. The idea is that
different industries might be at different stages of maturity and growth that
determine their dividend policies.

Table III summarizes the data by presenting the number of observations
we have for each country as well as country medians of several variables. Of
the firms in our sample, a little over one-quarter (1,135) are from civil law
countries and a little over three-quarters (2,968) are from common law countries. More than half of the firms in the sample come from the United States

Agency Problems and Dividend Policies

15

and the United Kingdom. Both of these countries have a large number of
listed firms; WorldScope coverage and the quality of data are also better for
richer countries. India, for example, has 5,398 listed firms in 1995, but only
one of them makes it into the sample.
The second column of Table III illustrates the finding of our earlier work,
namely that common law countries on average have stronger shareholder
protection, as illustrated by the median of the low shareholder protection
dummy, than do civil law countries. The z-statistic on the difference in the
median civil law and common law shareholder protection is 3.97.
The next three columns present country medians of our three dividend
payout ratios. The median of country median dividend-to-earnings ratios (the
most common payout metric used in the United States) is about 30 percent,
confirming that a substantial share of earnings is paid out as dividends.7
Paying dividends is indeed what large firms just about everywhere do, and
there is a dividend puzzle to be explained. Table III also reveals that, for all
measures, common law countries have higher payouts than civil law countries, and for two out of three the difference is statistically significant at the
5 percent level. We discuss this result in more detail below.
The sixth column shows that the median of country medians real growth
rate of sales in the sample is 4.13 percent. At the median of country medians, firms in civil law countries grow one percent faster than firms in common law countries.
A final point in Table III is that, in most countries, the difference between
the tax treatment of dividends and retained earnings is small. The United
States, with its significant tax advantage of retained earnings, is relatively
extreme.8
III. Results
A. Simple Statistics
We present the results in three steps. First, in Tables IV and V, we present
some basic statistics from our sample of firms that bear on the hypotheses
described in Section I. In computing these statistics, we weigh all the countries equally, so the United States and the U.K., where most firms in the
sample are located, do not receive any extra weight. Second, in Tables VI
and VII, we present the regressions on a cross section of companies that
control for tax and industry effects. In these regressions, countries that have
more companies automatically receive more weight. These two ways of presenting the data are thus complementary, since one can argue for both empirical strategies. Finally, we discuss the robustness of our results to several
alternative measurement and specification strategies.
7 Note that, in the calculation of this measure, the United States and the U.K. do not receive
any more weight than any other country.
8 In the computation of tax rates, we combine federal and local taxes. For example, for the
United States we add federal (28 percent) and New York State (7.75 percent) capital gains tax
rates.

Table IV

Dividends by Legal Origin and Growth Opportunities
This table classifies firms based on both the legal origin of the country in which they are
incorporated and on their growth in sales (GS) relative to the world median growth in sales.
Countries are required to have at least five valid observations (firms) with growth in sales
below the world median and five observations with growth in sales above the world median.
The number of countries in the resulting sample is 24 (14 civil law and 10 common law countries). To compute the world median growth in sales we calculate the median growth in sales for
each country and then we take medians again but now over the 24 resulting country observations. For each classification, the table reports the median value of the country medians for the
following three ratios: (1) dividend-to-cash-flow in Panel A; (2) dividend-to-earnings in Panel B;
and (3) dividend-to-sales in Panel C. Finally, Panel D reports Z-statistics for tests of difference
in medians.

In Tables IV and V, we present medians of country medians (MOMs) of
dividend payout ratios for various groups of firms, and in particular distinguish between rapidly and slowly growing firms. To have reasonably robust
statistics, we use a narrower sample in these tables than we do in Table III.
Specifically, we only consider countries where we have at least five firms
with sales growth above the world median sales growth of 4.1 percent, and
five firms with sales growth below the world median. This restriction leaves
us with 24 countries, and eliminates countries with very few firms from the
analysis. In the regressions, we go back to the broader sample.9
In Table IV, we examine whether firms in civil and common law countries
have different dividend payout policies. To begin, we compute the MOM for
the three dividend payout ratios for the civil and common law families sep9 We have also computed the medians without the restriction on the number of firms with
high and low growth rates in each country. The results are very similar.

Table V

Dividends by Legal Protection

and Growth Opportunities

This table classifies firms based both on the level of investor protection of the country in which
they are incorporated (low or high protection) and on their growth in sales (GS) relative to the
world median growth in sales. Countries included are required to have at least five valid observations (firms) with growth in sales below the world median and five observations with
growth in sales above the world median. The number of countries in the resulting sample is 24
(11 with low protection equal to one). To compute the world median growth in sales we calculate
the median growth in sales for each country and then we take medians again but now over the
24 resulting country-observations. For each classification, the table reports the median value
of the country-medians for the following three ratios: (1) dividend-to-cash-flow in Panel A;
(2) dividend-to-earnings in Panel B; and (3) dividend-to-sales in Panel C. Finally, Panel D reports Z-statistics for tests of difference in medians.

arately (the same measures, for a broader sample, are presented in Table III).
The results of this calculation are presented in the first column of Table IV.
For all three ratios, common law countries have a higher dividend payout
ratio than civil law countries do. The MOM dividend-to-cash-flow ratio is 17
percent for common law countries, and only 10.6 percent for civil law countries. The MOM dividend-to-earnings ratios are 36.3 percent for common law
countries, and 27.7 percent for civil law countries. The MOM dividend-tosales ratio is two percent for common law countries and 0.8 percent for civil
law countries. For all three variables, these estimates are very close to those
for the broader sample in Table III. Panel D of Table IV shows that, for two out
of the three measures of dividend payouts, the difference between the common
law MOM payout and the civil law MOM payout is statistically significant.
The results in the first column of Table IV are central to this paper. Recall
from Table III that common law countries generally have stronger minority
shareholder protection than civil law countries. The fact that common law

18

The Journal of Finance

countries also have higher dividend payouts supports the outcome agency
model of dividends, according to which better shareholder protection leads to
higher dividend payouts. In contrast, the result is inconsistent with the basic prediction of the substitute agency model of dividends. More generally,
the fact that dividend payouts are so different in environments with different shareholder protection suggests that agency considerations are likely to
be central to the explanation of why firms pay dividends.
The additional results in Table IV address the relationship between dividend payout rates and sales growth rates across legal regimes. For each
country with enough observations (see above), we separately compute the
median payout ratio for firms with above and firms with below the world
median sales growth rate. Within each origin, we then compute the MOM
payout across countries for rapidly and slowly growing firms separately. The
results are presented in the last two columns of Table IV, and again are
consistent across all three measures of dividend payouts. In common law
countries, payout ratios are strictly higher for slowly growing firms than for
rapidly growing firms. In the common law family, the MOM dividend-tocash-flow ratio is 15.2 percent for rapidly growing firms and 22.9 percent for
slowly growing firms; the MOM dividend-to-earnings ratio is 28 percent for
rapidly growing firms and 41 percent for slowly growing firms; and the
MOM dividend-to-sales ratio is 1.8 percent for rapidly growing firms and
2.9 percent for slowly growing firms. These differences between mature and
growth firms in common law countries are statistically significant (see
Panel D). These results are consistent with the predictions of the outcome
agency model, according to which well-protected minority shareholders are
willing to delay dividends in firms with good growth prospects.
In the civil law family, in contrast, rapidly growing firms appear, if anything, to pay higher dividends. In this family, the MOM dividend-to-cashflow ratio is 10.9 percent for rapidly growing firms and 9.2 percent for slowly
growing firms; the MOM dividend-to-earnings ratio is 30.3 percent for rapidly and 21.3 percent for slowly growing firms; and finally the MOM dividendto-sales ratio is 0.9 percent for rapidly and 0.8 percent for slowly growing
firms. The positive association between dividend payouts and growth rates
in civil law countries is consistent with the dividends as substitutes theory
applying to these countries. However, as Panel D shows, these payout differences between mature and growth firms in civil law countries are not
statistically significant, and hence we should not read too much into this
finding.
Table V presents calculations similar to those in Table IV, except that now
countries are sorted by whether the low shareholder protection dummy is
equal to zero or one. As in Table IV, we use the narrow sample of countries.
The results are similar to those in Table IV, and we summarize them only
briefly. First, on all measures of dividend payouts, countries with better
shareholder protection have higher dividend payout ratios than do countries
with worse protection. Second, again on all measures of dividend payouts,
within countries with good shareholder protection, high growth firms have

Agency Problems and Dividend Policies

19

lower dividend payouts than low growth firms. The differences are statistically significant at the 5 percent level in two cases, and at the 10 percent
level in the third. Finally, on all measures of dividend payouts, within countries with low shareholder protection, high growth firms have higher dividend payouts than low growth firms. These differences are not statistically
significant, however.
The preliminary results are consistent with the outcome agency model.
However, the findings may be driven by some heterogeneity of countries
correlated with legal origin or investor protection. Accordingly, we next move
to a regression analysis that attempts to control for the differences in tax
regimes and in industrial composition in different countries.
B. Regressions
Table VI presents the results of regressions across 4,103 firms in 33 countries around the world. We use the broader sample described in Table III. We
employ a random effects specification that explicitly accounts for the crosscorrelation between error terms for firms in the same country. We control for
the tax advantage of dividends, which is specific to each country, but not for
industry effects until Table VII. We report results for all three measures of
the dividend payout ratio. We use dummies to proxy for the quality of legal
protection of investors. For each payout variable, we present one regression
that distinguishes between common and civil law countries, and one regression that distinguishes between low and high shareholder protection countries, and one that includes both the origin and the protection dummies. As
a measure of investment opportunities in the regressions, we use the decile
rank of the past average annual sales growth rate for each firm, GS_decile.
In this calculation, the deciles of growth rates are defined separately for
companies in common and civil law families. Using deciles gives us a less
widely spread variable, and defining deciles separately for the two families
ensures that we have enough high growth firms in civil law countries. We
also include an interaction between GS_decile and the legal origin or the low
investor protection dummy.
The tax variable enters with the positive sign in all specifications, but is
only statistically significant in the dividend-to-sales ratio regressions. The
interpretation of this result is highly ambiguous. The positive coefficients
can be interpreted as some support for the traditional view, under which
taxes discourage the payment of dividends. The insignificance of these coefficients, however, may be interpreted as evidence in favor of the "new view,"
under which tax payments are already capitalized in the value of the firm
and therefore do not influence dividend policy. Last, the evidence may mean
that our computations do not adequately address the nuances of each country's tax treatment of dividends.
Consider first the regressions that use only one measure of investor rights
at a time. The civil law dummy enters with a negative and significant coefficient at the 1 percent level in regressions using all three measures of

dividend payouts.10 Using the dividend to cash flow ratio, for example, common law countries have a 13.3 percentage point higher payout, other things
equal. The coefficient on GS_decile is negative and also significant at the
1 percent level, and implies that, for common law countries, moving from
the bottom to the top decile of sales growth rate is associated with a 7.6 percentage point lower dividend to cash flow ratio. That is, in common law
countries, higher growth firms pay moderately lower dividends. At the
same time, the coefficient on the interaction between GS_decile and the civil
law dummy is highly statistically significant and of roughly the same magnitude as that on GS_decile in all three regressions. This implies that, other
things equal, there is no relationship between sales growth and dividend
payouts in civil law countries. The results using the civil law dummy, like
the medians in Table IV, are consistent with the outcome agency model of
dividends.-1
Similar results obtain using the low shareholder protection dummy. The
coefficient on that dummy is negative and significant at the 1 percent level
using all measures of payout.12 The coefficient on GS_decile as before is
negative and significant, implying that, in countries with good shareholder
protection, faster growing firms pay lower dividends. The coefficient on the
interaction between GS_decile and the low shareholder protection dummy is
positive and of about the same magnitude, indicating that the relationship
between growth and payouts does not hold in countries with poor shareholder protection. These results also suggest that dividends are an outcome of
pressure on the insiders to pay out profits.
When both the civil law dummy and the poor shareholder protection dummy
are included in the regression, in two out of three cases the former remains
significant, while the latter does not. (In the third case, both variables lose
significance.) Although it is best not to put too much weight on this result
given that the two variables are correlated, one view is that our measure of
shareholder protection does not perfectly capture some of the differences
between the legal regimes. For example, as argued in LLSV (1998), the quality of law enforcement-which
surely matters for shareholder power-is also
better in common law than in civil law countries. The other results do not
change appreciably when both dummies are included at the same time.
In Table VII, we use industry-adjusted growth in sales and industryadjusted dividends to control for industry effects, and otherwise estimate
the same equations as in Table VI (the details of the adjustment are described in Table II). The industry adjustment does not change the thrust of
10 The civil law dummy is also highly significant when included in the regression on its own,
without the growth in sales variables.
" These results also survive the inclusion of a measure of the quality of accounting standards, described in LLSV (1998), available for 31 countries in the sample (not Ireland and
Indonesia).

when included in the

our results. Countries from the common law family, as well as countries
with good shareholder protection, pay higher industry-adjusted dividends,
and, moreover, in these countries, faster growing firms pay lower dividends,
other things equal.

C. Robustness
In this subsection, we briefly describe the results of some of the robustness checks of our findings. One question is whether the regression results
are shaped by firms from the United States and the U.K., which are the
majority of the sample. Of course, the results in Tables IV and V weigh all
countries equally, but one might want to know more about firm-level data.
Accordingly, Figures 3 and 4 present the plots of dividend payouts against
sales growth for each of the 11 common law and 20 civil law countries respectively.13 Figure 3 shows that there is a negative relationship between
growth in sales and dividend-to-earnings ratios in every one of the 11 common law countries. Figure 4 shows that this relationship is negative for 11
of the 20 civil law countries, and positive for nine of the 20. If we plot the
ratio of dividends to cash flow against sales growth, the relationship is again
negative for all 11 common law countries, and for 11 out of 20 civil law
countries. Finally, if we plot the ratio of dividends to sales against sales
growth, the relationship is negative for 10 of the 11 common law countries,
and for 10 of the 20 civil law countries. In summary, while the results for
different countries hold with different levels of statistical significance, they
consistently show that more rapidly growing firms pay lower dividends in
common law, but not in civil law countries.14
A further concern about our results is that we might have selected a particular point in time during national (or international) business cycles that
makes our results special. To address this concern, we reestimate all regressions using 1992, 1993, and 1994 dividend variables, and look at three-year
rather than five-year past sales growth rates (thus, for example, we have
related measures of 1992 dividends to 1989 to 1991 sales growth rates). Our
results hold using these alternative points in time for measuring dividend
payouts and investment opportunities.
A related point deals with the inherent crudeness in measuring investment opportunities in terms of the past growth rate in sales. We have chosen to use the past growth rate in sales to avoid the incompatibility of
accounting variables across countries. To check robustness, we have also
reestimated our results using growth rates of assets, fixed assets, cash flow,
and earnings, as well as industry Q, as measures of investment opportuni-

We do not have enough observations to run a regression for India and Indonesia.
Very similar results obtain if we divide three countries by high versus low antidirector

ties. The results generally confirm the reported findings in both sign and
significance, although the relationship between industry Q and dividends is
insignificant.
One possible alternative interpretation of our results is that our measures
of investor protection simply reflect the degree of capital market development. It is possible that firms in developed capital markets are happy to pay
out their earnings because they can always raise more external funds, whereas
firms in undeveloped capital markets would hold on to the hard-to-get cash.
This view would explain our finding that, on average, dividend payouts are
higher in countries with good investor protection, which also happen to be
countries with developed capital markets.
This alternative view has its own problems, however. To begin, the degree
of capital market development is to a significant extent endogenous, and
indeed in part determined by legal origin and the quality of investor protection (LLSV (1997)). Moreover, this view does not explain our findings on
the relationship between investment opportunities and payouts. If anything,
this view would imply that firms in poorly developed capital markets should
exhibit extreme sensitivity of payouts to growth opportunities, and really
try to hoard cash when they have good investments. In contrast, firms in
developed markets should be willing to pay dividends regardless of investment opportunities since they can count on raising external funds. Contrary
to these predictions, our data show that the negative relationship between
investment opportunities and payouts is stronger in countries with good investor protection and hence more developed capital markets.
As a final point, we briefly address a possibly important objection to our
analysis, which states that perhaps the evidence of lower payouts in civil
law (or poor shareholder protection) countries simply reflects greater reliance on debt finance in those countries. First, as an empirical matter, we
use the ratios of dividends to cash flow and to earnings, so the denominators
already take out interest payments. Even if firms in civil law countries rely
on debt to a greater extent, they should not necessarily pay out less of their
net-of-interest income. Second, it is not generally the case that firms in civil
law countries rely more on debt finance. Indeed, many of these countries,
particularly French civil law countries, have poor legal protection of both
shareholders and creditors, and hence have both smaller debt and smaller
equity markets (LLSV (1997)). The idea that countries with poorly developed
stock markets necessarily, or even on average, have better developed lending
mechanisms is simply a myth. Last, we actually test the validity of this
objection by including a country-specific measure of debt finance from LLSV
(1997), namely the ratio of aggregate private debt to GNP, in the regressions
in Tables VI and VII. The coefficients on the debt variable are positive,
though generally insignificant, while the magnitudes and the statistical significance of shareholder protection coefficients remain largely unaffected.
This finding is inconsistent with the argument that poor shareholder protection is associated with lower dividend payouts because of substitution of
financing into debt.

Agency Problems and Dividend Policies

27

IV. Conclusion
This paper uses a sample of firms from 33 countries around the world to
shed light on dividend policies of large corporations. We take advantage of
different legal protection of minority shareholders across these countries to
compare dividend policies of companies whose minority shareholders face
different risks of expropriation of their wealth by corporate insiders. We use
this cross-sectional variation to examine the agency approach to dividend policy.
We distinguish two alternative agency models of dividends. In the first
model, dividends are an outcome of effective legal protection of shareholders,
which enables minority shareholders to extract dividend payments from corporate insiders. In the second, dividends are a substitute for effective legal
protection, which enables firms in unprotective legal environments to establish reputations for good treatment of investors through dividend policies.
Our data suggest that the agency approach is highly relevant to an understanding of corporate dividend policies around the world. More precisely,
we find consistent support for the outcome agency model of dividends. Firms
operating in countries with better protection of minority shareholders pay
higher dividends. Moreover, in these countries, fast growth firms pay lower
dividends than slow growth firms, consistent with the idea that legally protected shareholders are willing to wait for their dividends when investment
opportunities are good. On the other hand, poorly protected shareholders
seem to take whatever dividends they can get, regardless of investment opportunities. This apparent misallocation of investment is presumably part of
the agency cost of poor legal protection.
In our analysis, we find no conclusive evidence on the effect of taxes on
dividend policies. Nor can we use our data to assess the relevance of dividend signaling. In fact, our results are consistent with the idea that, on the
margin, dividend policies of firms may convey information to some investors. Despite the possible relevance of alternative theories, firms appear to
pay out cash to investors because the opportunities to steal or misinvest it
are in part limited by law, and because minority shareholders have enough
power to extract it. In this respect, the quality of legal protection of investors
is as important for dividend policies as it is for other key corporate decisions.

Appendix

A

Table A.I presents the raw data used to calculate the tax preference of
dividends for each country. We use the tax rates faced by local residents who
acquire minority stakes in publicly traded securities and hold their investments long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains tax rates. Furthermore, we assume that the effective tax rate on capital gains is equivalent to
one-fourth of the nominal rate (Poterba (1987)). Finally, we combine federal
and local taxes whenever possible. In order to compute the tax parameter, it
is helpful to use the criteria proposed by King (1977) and group the tax
systems of the countries in our sample in three broad categories:

The Journal of Finance
1. The Classical System: Personal and corporate taxation are independent of each other and shareholders receive no compensation for taxes
paid at the corporate level. Specifically, the company pays a flat rate of
corporate tax on profits (i.e., distributed and undistributed income are
taxed at the same rate) and shareholders pay income tax on dividend
receipts. Accordingly, the value to an investor of one dollar in earnings
distributed in the form of dividends is equal to (1 - Tcorp) * (1 - Tdiv),
where Tcorp iS the corporate tax rate on income and Tdiv is the personal
tax rate on dividend receipts. Similarly, the value to an investor of
one dollar in earnings retained inside the firm is given by (1 - Tcorp) *
(1 - Tcap), where Tcap is the effective personal tax rate on capital gains.
Therefore, the dividend tax preference parameter (defined as the ratio
of the value earnings distributed as dividends versus earnings retained inside the firm) is given by (1 - Tdiv)/(l - Tcap).
2. The Two-Rate System: The corporate tax rate on earnings distributed
as dividends is lower than on retained earnings to mitigate the tax
advantage of retained earnings in the classical system. Accordingly, the
value to an investor of one dollar in earnings distributed in the form of
dividends is equal to (1 - Tdist) * (1 - Tdiv), where Tdist is the corporate
tax rate on distributed income. Similarly, the value to an investor of
one dollar in earnings retained inside the firm is given by (1 - Tret) *
where Tret is the corporate tax rate on retained earnings.
(1 - Tcap),
Thus, the dividend tax preference parameter is given by (1 - Tdist) *
- Tret) * (1 - Tcap))In practice, the pure two-rate system
(1 - Tdiv)/((l
is implemented rarely in our sample of countries. In fact, only two
countries in our sample have different tax rates for retained earnings
and dividends: Germany and South Africa. However, in South Africa
the taxes on dividends are higher than on retained earnings contrary
to the motivation behind the two-rate system, (Tdiv = 49 percent versus
dividends in Germany are not only
Tret = 40 percent). Interestingly,
taxed at a lower corporate rate but shareholders are allowed to credit
taxes paid by corporations on distributions to offset personal taxes in
the same way as in the imputation system.
3. The Imputation System: Shareholders receive credit for taxes paid by
the company on earnings distributed as dividends. These credits may
be used to offset shareholder's tax liability. Part of the corporate tax
liability on distributed profits is "imputed" to shareholders and regarded as a prepayment of their personal income tax. In the most frequent version of the imputation system, dividends are regarded as having
borne personal tax at the "imputation" rate -rimp and shareholders are
liable only for the difference between their marginal tax rates on personal income and the imputation rate (i.e., they pay taxes on dividend

receipts at the rate

Tdiv -

Timp).

Accordingly,the value to an investor of

one dollar in earnings distributed in the form of dividends is equal to
(1 - Tcorp + Timp) * (1 - Tdiv). Hence, the dividend tax preference parameter is given by (1 - Tdist + Timp) * (1 - Tdiv)/((l - Tret) * (1 - Tcap))-

Less frequently, the operation of the system is defined in terms of a
tax credit rate Tcred and not an imputation rate. In countries that rely
on tax credits, shareholders are liable for the difference between the
personal taxes owed on dividends-cum-tax-credit received and the tax
credit (i.e., they pay taxes on dividend receipts at the rate (1 + Tcred) *
In such cases, we re-express Tcred in terms of its associated
Tdiv - Tcred.).
