Abstract
We model the conditional mean and volatility of stock returns as a latent VAR process to
study their contemporaneous and intertemporal relationships in a ﬂexible statistical
framework and without relying on exogenous predictors. We ﬁnd a strong and robust
negative correlation between the innovations to the conditional moments leading to
pronounced countercyclical variation in the Sharpe ratio. We document signiﬁcant lead-lag
correlations between the moments that also appear related to business cycles. Finally, we show
that although the conditional correlation between the mean and volatility is negative, the
unconditional correlation is positive due to these lead-lag correlations.

1. Introduction
The relationship between the mean and volatility of returns is a central issue in
ﬁnance. Many asset pricing models imply a proportional relationship between
expected excess returns and risk in the cross-section and over time. Unfortunately,
the empirical relationship between the mean and volatility of returns, and in
particular stock returns, is much less regular. It has proven difﬁcult to explain all
cross-sectional differences in expected stock returns through differential risks (e.g.,
Fama and French, 1996). Furthermore, the evidence on the time-series relationship
between the conditional mean and volatility of stock returns is inconclusive and
depends on the model and exogenous predictors used to draw inferences (e.g.,
Harvey, 2001). In this paper, we examine more closely the time-series relationship
between the conditional mean and volatility using a latent vector autoregressive
(VAR) process for the two moments. This latent VAR approach allows us to study
the contemporaneous and intertemporal relationships between expected returns and
risk in a ﬂexible statistical framework and, more importantly, without relying on
exogenous predictors.
It is clear from both the volatility ratio tests of LeRoy and Porter (1981) and the
long-horizon autoregressions of Fama and French (1988) that expected returns are
time-varying. Predictive regressions have been used widely to capture the time
variation of expected returns with an expanding set of predictors, such as the
dividend yield, short rate, term premium, and default premium. However, there is
increasing concern over predictive regressions in light of statistical issues (Boudoukh
and Richardson, 1993; Stambaugh, 1999; Ferson et al., 2000; Valkanov, 2002) and
their lack of robustness and out-of-sample predictive power (Bossaerts and Hillion,
1999; Ang and Bekaert, 2001; Goyal and Welch, 2002).
Time-varying volatility is even more ﬁrmly established and is typically modelled in
an ARCH or stochastic volatility (SV) framework; see Bollerslev et al. (1992) and
Ghysels et al. (1996) for literature surveys. In ARCH models, the conditional
variance of returns depends deterministically both on lagged squared returns and
lagged variances, while in SV models the conditional variance is a stochastic process.
The fact that in an ARCH model all randomness is ex post observable (through
returns) implies that the volatility realizations can be recovered from the data. As a
result, ARCH models are easy to estimate and quite popular. In SV models, in
contrast, the innovations to the volatility process are random and the volatility
realizations are therefore unobservable. Estimating an SV model involves integrating
out the latent volatilities. The computation of this high-dimensional integral is
analytically difﬁcult and computationally intensive, causing SV models to be less
popular than ARCH models despite their statistical and economic appeal.1
1
Not until recently have effective methods for estimating SV models been developed. These econometric
methods include quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) (Harvey et al., 1994; Alizadeh et al., 2002), simulated
maximum likelihood (SML) (Danielsson, 1994; Sandmann and Koopman, 1998), Markov chain Monte
Carlo (Jacquier et al., 1994; Kim et al., 1998), and the simulated method of moments (SMM) (Dufﬁe and
Singleton, 1993; Andersen and Sorensen, 1994).

Given the empirical evidence on both time-varying expected returns and volatility,
it is only natural to examine the comovements of the two moments through time.
Unfortunately, the ﬁndings on this relationship are mixed. Using volatility-in-mean
models (essentially ARCH models in which the variance enters contemporaneously
in the mean return), French et al. (1987) and Campbell and Hentschel (1992)
estimate a positive correlation, while Campbell (1987), Breen et al. (1989), Nelson
(1991), and Glosten et al. (1993) all report a negative correlation. Koopman and
Uspensky (1999) ﬁnd evidence of a weak negative relationship with an SV-in-mean
model but a weak positive relationship with an ARCH-based volatility-in-mean
model. Harrison and Zhang (1999) employ Gallant and Tauchen’s (1989)
semiparametric method to document a positive relationship between the conditional
mean and volatility at long horizons but none at short horizons (such as a month).
Finally, Harvey (2001) uses exogenous predictors and ﬁnds that the correlation
between the moments generally depends on the model and the conditioning
information used in the mean and variance estimation.
We examine more closely the time-series relationship between the conditional
moments through a latent VAR model. The ﬁrst equation of the VAR describes the
dynamics of the conditional mean. It captures the temporary component in the
permanent and temporary components model of Fama and French (1988) and
Lamoureux and Zhou (1996), in which stock prices are governed by a random walk
and a stationary process, respectively. The second equation of the VAR describes the
dynamics of the conditional volatility. It nests the standard SV model studied by
Wiggins (1987), Andersen and Sorensen (1994), Jacquier et al. (1994), and Kim et al.
(1998), among others.
The latent VAR allows us to study the contemporaneous and intertemporal
relationships between the conditional mean and volatility in a ﬂexible statistical
framework and without relying on exogenous predictors. With respect to the
contemporaneous relationship, the mean equation of the VAR resembles the
volatility-in-mean model used by French et al. (1987) and others to measure
the contemporaneous effect of volatility on expected returns. In addition to this
volatility-in-mean effect, there is a symmetric mean-in-volatility effect in the
volatility equation. If a change in the volatility has a contemporaneous effect on the
mean, a change in the mean also has a contemporaneous effect on the volatility.
With regard to the intertemporal relationship, the VAR allows for lag adjustments of
the volatility to changes in the mean, and similarly of the mean to changes in the
volatility, which Whitelaw (1994) claims to be salient features of the data. Analogous
to the contemporaneous effects, we refer to these lag adjustments as lag-volatility-inmean and lag-mean-in-volatility effects.
Whitelaw (1994) considers a VAR model similar to ours, except he uses fitted
moments from a set of ﬁrst-stage predictive regressions as proxies for the
unobservable conditional mean and volatility. The obvious drawback of using ﬁtted
moments is that their dynamics are determined by the joint conditional distribution
of the ﬁrst-stage predictors. Thus, with only slight model misspeciﬁcation, such as
omitted variables, the dynamics of the ﬁtted moments do not need to correspond to
those of the true moments. Another problem with using ﬁtted moments is that even if

the predictive models for the conditional mean and volatility are well speciﬁed, the
effect of errors in variables which are induced by the ﬁrst-stage regressions is not
trivial to quantify in a VAR. Our approach is not subject to these critiques because
we treat the conditional mean and volatility as latent state variables.
We use simulated maximum likelihood (SML) based on importance sampling to
estimate the parameters of the VAR model and to extract estimates of the latent
mean, volatility, and implied Sharpe ratio time series. We then examine the
contemporaneous and intertemporal relationship between the conditional mean and
volatility through the parameter estimates, extracted series, and impulse response
functions of the estimated VAR.
Among our empirical results, the following are particularly interesting:2

The contemporaneous correlation between the innovations to the conditional
mean and volatility is negative and statistically signiﬁcant (according to
asymptotic standard errors and corroborated by Monte Carlo experiments),
implying negative volatility-in-mean and mean-in-volatility effects.
The negative contemporaneous correlation between the mean and volatility
generates substantial variation in the conditional Sharpe ratio that is distinctly
countercyclical. Every business cycle since 1946 is associated with an almost
monotonic rise in the Sharpe ratio from the peak to the trough of the cycle.
Both lag adjustments, the lag-volatility-in-mean and the lag-mean-in-volatility
effects, are positive and statistically signiﬁcant, according to the asymptotic
and ﬁnite sample standard errors. Furthermore, the timing of the lag adjustment appears related to business cycles as well. Whenever the economy comes
off the peak of a cycle, the conditional volatility rises immediately. The
conditional mean, however, increases only gradually as the economy moves from
the peak to the trough of the cycle. Therefore, the volatility appears to lead the
mean through the recession by about six months. The mean reaches a high at the
trough of the cycle, shortly after which the volatility drops again to a normal level.
As a result, the increase in the mean is associated with a subsequent drop in the
volatility.
Despite the large and negative contemporaneous correlation between the
innovations to the conditional mean and volatility, which measures the
conditional (on the lagged mean and lagged volatility) correlation between
the moments, the unconditional contemporaneous correlation between the mean
and volatility is large and positive due to the strong lag-volatility-in-mean effect.
Unconditionally, times of high expected returns are associated with high
volatility. We argue that this difference between the conditional and unconditional correlations may explain the disagreement in the literature about the
contemporaneous correlation.

2
We draw inferences with asymptotic standard errors. However, since the asymptotics of our estimator
are questionable (see Section 3.4), we corroborate the evidence on the key results with Monte Carlo
experiments.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets up the latent
VAR for the conditional mean and volatility, derives the implied dynamics of the
Sharpe ratio, explains the link to equilibrium asset pricing models, and outlines the
hypotheses we want to test within this framework. We describe our econometric
approach in Section 3. Section 4 then presents our empirical results in six
subsections: Section 4.1 describes the data, Section 4.2 reports the parameter
estimates and the results of the hypothesis tests, Section 4.3 analyzes the extracted
latent processes, Section 4.4 interprets the impulse response functions, Section 4.5
tries to reconcile the disagreement in the literature about the sign of the
contemporaneous correlation between the conditional mean and volatility, and
Section 4.6 incorporates exogenous predictors as a robustness check. We conclude in
Section 5 with a summary of our main results.

The key parameters of the latent VAR are the transition matrix A and the
contemporaneous correlation coefﬁcient r: The diagonal elements of A reﬂect the
persistence of the conditional moments, and the off-diagonal elements capture
the intertemporal feedback of the conditional volatility to the conditional mean and
vice versa. The coefﬁcient r represents the contemporaneous correlation between the
innovations to the conditional moments.
We entertain three assumptions about the correlation between the return
innovations et and the conditional moment innovations Zt : The ﬁrst assumption is
that the return innovations are uncorrelated with the conditional moment
innovations, or, Corr½et Zs  ¼ ½0; 00 for all s and t: Second, we assume that the
return innovations are contemporaneously correlated with either the conditional
mean or the conditional volatility innovations, but not both. Formally, either
Corr½et Zt  ¼ ½rm ; 00 or Corr½et Zt  ¼ ½0; rs 0 : The third assumption is that the return
innovations are contemporaneously correlated with both conditional moment
innovations, so that Corr½et Zt  ¼ ½rm ; rs 0 :
2.2. Interpretation
We model the conditional moments as exponential Gaussian processes. For the
mean, this modelling choice guarantees a positive risk premium, which is a sensible
assumption for the market portfolio and has been used in similar contexts by
Bekaert and Harvey (1995) and De Santis and Gerard (1997,1998). For the volatility,
the implied log-normality is consistent with the recent empirical ﬁndings of Andersen
et al. (2001).
Our latent VAR model fuses and generalizes the permanent and temporary
components model of Fama and French (1988) and the standard SV model.
The ﬁrst equation of the VAR describes the dynamics of the conditional
mean as
ln mt ¼ d1 þ a11 ln mt1 þ a12 ln st1 þ Z1t ;

with Z1t BN½0; b11 :

ð5Þ

This equation captures the temporary component of Fama and French’s permanent
and temporary components model, in which stock prices are governed by a random
walk and a stationary autoregressive process, respectively. In fact, with a12 ¼ 0; this
model of the temporary component is the same as that of Lamoureux and Zhou
(1996) (except in logs). The second equation of the VAR describes the volatility
dynamics as
ln st ¼ d2 þ a21 ln mt1 þ a22 ln st1 þ Z2t ;

with Z2t BN½0; b22 

ð6Þ

and nests the standard SV model. With a21 ¼ 0; Eq. (6) is the SV model estimated by
Wiggins (1987), Andersen and Sorensen (1994), Jacquier et al. (1994), Kim et al.
(1998), and many others.
The mean equation also resembles the volatility-in-mean model used by French
et al. (1987) and Glosten et al. (1993) to explore the contemporaneous relationship
between the conditional mean and volatility. To illustrate the connection to the

volatility-in-mean model, we project Z1t onto Z2t ; such that
Z1t ¼ b1 Z2t þ x1t

where x1t is uncorrelated with Z2t by construction and

We then rewrite Eq. (6) as
Z2t ¼ ln st  d2  a21 ln mt1  a22 ln st1

and substitute it and Eq. (7) into Eq. (5) to get
ln mt ¼ ðd1  b1 d2 Þ þ ða11  b1 a21 Þ ln mt1
þ ða12  b1 a22 Þ ln st1 þ b1 ln st þ x1t :

ð10Þ

This reduced-form equation for the conditional mean is a generalized version of
the usual volatility-in-mean model, in which the conditional mean depends
contemporaneously on the conditional volatility.3 The volatility-in-mean effect
depends on the projection coefﬁcient b1 and therefore indirectly on the correlation
coefﬁcient r:
Our model extends the volatility-in-mean model in two ways. First, unless jrj ¼ 1;
there are two sources of randomness in the conditional mean process, as opposed to
only one, which breaks the overly restrictive one-to-one link between the conditional
mean and volatility imposed by the usual volatility-in-mean model. Second, not only
the current but also the lagged volatility affects the conditional mean, whereas the
usual volatility-in-mean model involves only a contemporaneous effect. Analogous
to the volatility-in-mean effect, we label the effect of the lagged volatility the lagvolatility-in-mean effect. The lag-volatility-in-mean effect depends on a12  b1 a22 : If
this term is positive (negative), the lagged conditional volatility has a positive
(negative) effect on the conditional mean.
Likewise, we can obtain the reduced-form volatility dynamics:
ln st ¼ ðd2  b2 d1 Þ þ ða22  b2 a12 Þ ln st1
þ ða21  b2 a11 Þ ln mt1 þ b2 ln mt þ x2t ;
where

and
Z2t ¼ b2 Z1t þ x2t

with x2t BN½0; ð1  r2 Þb22 :

ð13Þ

The standard volatility-in-mean model relates the mean return to the volatility (or variance), while our
model relates the log mean to the log volatility. Let q ¼ dm=ds be the usual volatility-in-mean coefﬁcient.
Then, our coefﬁcient on the log-volatility-in-log-mean d ln m=d ln s ¼ ðdm=dsÞðs=mÞ ¼ qs=m has the same
sign as the usual volatility-in-mean coefﬁcient, since both m and s are positive.

This reduced-form volatility model captures the persistence of volatility through the
term a22  b2 a12 : In addition, it incorporates the effects of the mean on the volatility,
both at the contemporaneous and intertemporal levels, through the coefﬁcients b2
and a21  b2 a11 ; respectively. Analogous to the volatility-in-mean and lag-volatilityin-mean effects, we label the coefﬁcient on the contemporaneous mean the mean-involatility effect and the coefﬁcient on the lagged mean the lag-mean-in-volatility
effect. The correlation r between the mean and volatility innovations is again vital in
determining the sign and magnitude of the mean-in-volatility and lag-mean-involatility effects (through b2 ).
The mean-in-volatility effect mirrors the volatility-in-mean effect. Since b1 b2 ¼ r2 ;
the two effects share the same sign. However, unless jrj ¼ 1; the mean-in-volatility
and volatility-in-mean effects are not perfect reciprocals of each other. The ratio
b1 =b2 measures the variance of the mean innovations relative to that of the volatility
innovations.
The motivation for including the non-contemporaneous lag-volatility-in-mean
and lag-mean-in-volatility effects, a12  b1 a22 and a21  b2 a11 ; respectively, is mostly
empirical. Whitelaw (1994) documents signiﬁcant lead-lag interactions between the
conditional mean and volatility. Although it is possible that his results are an artifact
of the exogenous predictors used to measure the time variation of the moments, it is
equally possible that the lead-lag interactions are a systematic but until-now
overlooked feature of the relationship between expected returns and risk. In fact,
Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) document similar lead-lag interactions using different
exogenous predictors, which is evidence in favor of the second possibility.
Finally, the three assumptions about the correlation between the return
innovations and the conditional moment innovations serve to capture and
potentially distinguish two popular explanations of asymmetric volatility. Asymmetric volatility refers to the empirical ﬁnding that increases in volatility tend to be
associated more often with large negative returns than with equally large positive
returns. The two popular explanations of asymmetric volatility are the leverage effect
and the volatility feedback effect. The leverage effect states that when the value of a
ﬁrm drops given a large negative return, the leverage of the ﬁrm and the associated
probability of bankruptcy increase, causing the equity claims to become riskier. The
volatility feedback effect attributes the asymmetric volatility to the equilibrium
response of the conditional mean to changes in volatility. Suppose a large
negative return is associated with an increase in the conditional volatility
(in the spirit of an ARCH model) and the price of risk is positive, so that the
increase in the conditional volatility leads to an increase in the conditional mean.
Holding future dividends ﬁxed, the expected return can only increase by a drop
in the current stock price, resulting in an even larger negative return. In contrast,
for a large positive return that also leads to an increase in both conditional
moments, the drop in the stock price associated with the increase in the expected
return partially offsets the positive return. As a result, the increase in volatility is
associated with a large negative return (enhanced by the increase in the conditional
mean) or a small positive return (partially offset by the increase in the conditional
mean).

225

The assumption that the return innovations are independent of the conditional
moment innovations, rs ¼ rm ¼ 0; rules out both the leverage and volatility
feedback effects. A negative correlation between the return and conditional volatility
innovations, rs o0; is consistent with the leverage effect. It can also be consistent
with the volatility feedback effect, but only if the contemporaneous correlation
between the conditional moments is positive, r > 0: If the contemporaneous
correlation between the conditional moments is negative, the volatility feedback
effect implies a positive correlation between the return and conditional volatility
innovations, rs > 0; because negative returns are offset and positive returns are
enhanced by the decrease in the conditional mean associated with the increase in the
conditional volatility. Furthermore, since in our model the conditional mean can
vary independently of the conditional volatility (unless jrj ¼ 1), a more direct way to
capture the intuition of the volatility feedback effect is through a negative correlation
between the return and conditional mean innovations, rm o0; which directly ties
increases (decreases) in the conditional mean to negative (positive) returns. Finally,
the case in which rm o0 and rs o0 allows for both effects, regardless of the sign and
magnitude of the contemporaneous correlation between the conditional mean and
volatility.4
2.3. Implied sharpe ratio dynamics
The latent VAR implies that the conditional Sharpe ratio is log-normally
distributed and that it follows a two-factor autoregressive (AR) process. We deﬁne
the log Sharpe ratio as
"
#

#
ln
m

ln St ¼ ln mt  ln st ¼ T 0
; where T ¼

which shows that the variation in the log Sharpe ratio is driven by the mean reversion
of the two conditional moments and by the difference between the conditional moment
innovations, Z1t  Z2t : Given the joint normality of Zt ; the difference between the
innovations is normally distributed and so is the log Sharpe ratio.
It follows that the Sharpe ratio is stochastic unless Z1t  Z2t is zero. In particular, it
is stochastic even if the innovations to the mean and volatility are perfectly
correlated, with jrj ¼ 1: The reason is that even if the innovations are perfectly
correlated, their magnitudes are different, unless b11 ¼ b22 ; and therefore the

We can disentangle rm and rs from r by factoring the innovations Zt into a common component due to
the correlations with the return innovations et and the components

innovations but are correlated with each other by r* ¼ ðr  rm rs Þ= ð1  r2m Þð1  r2s Þ:

difference between the innovations is nonzero. For example, suppose r ¼ 1: If b11 >
b22 ; the Sharpe ratio increases whenever the mean increases, because the volatility
increases by less than the mean. Alternatively, if b11 ob22 ; the Sharpe ratio decreases
whenever the mean increases, because the volatility increases by more than the mean.
The Sharpe ratio is only nonstochastic if jrj ¼ 1 and b11 ¼ b22 : Of course, even in this
case the Sharpe ratio is still time-varying due to the mean reversion of the two
conditional moments (because ln mt1 and ln st1 are time-varying).
Substituting ln mt1 ¼ ln St1 þ ln st1 or ln st1 ¼ ln mt1  ln St1 into Eq. (15)
illustrates that the log Sharpe ratio follows an AR process:
ln St ¼ ðd1  d2 Þ þ ða11  a21 Þ ln St1
þ ða11 þ a12  a21  a22 Þ ln st1  ð1  b1 ÞZ2t þ x1t

ð16Þ

or
ln St ¼ ðd1  d2 Þ þ ða22  a12 Þ ln St1
þ ða11 þ a12  a21  a22 Þ ln mt1 þ ð1  b2 ÞZ1t  x2t ;

ð17Þ

respectively. In fact, if a11 þ a12  a21  a22 ¼ 0; the log Sharpe ratio follows a
univariate AR process, which is fairly standard in the term structure and portfolio
choice literatures. A sufﬁcient condition for this case is that a12 ¼ a21 ¼ 0 and a11 ¼
a22 ; or in words, that both the conditional mean and volatility are univariate AR
processes with the same persistence levels. Otherwise, if a11 þ a12  a21  a22 a0; the
latent VAR introduces a second factor into the Sharpe ratio dynamics, namely the
lagged conditional volatility in Eq. (16) or the lagged conditional mean in Eq. (17). It
is important to recognize, however, that although the own-lag coefﬁcients depend on
which conditional moment is used as the second factor (a11  a21 versus a22  a12 ),
the overall time-series dynamics of the log Sharpe ratios (including the persistence
level) are the same in Eqs. (16) and (17) because, given the deﬁnition ln St ¼
ln mt  ln st ; the two equations are mathematically equivalent.
2.4. Link to equilibrium models
To gain some economic intuition about the Sharpe ratio dynamics, consider the
ﬁrst-order condition Et ½Mtþ1 ðRtþ1  Rft Þ ¼ 0 of a representative investor with
marginal utility growth Mtþ1 (the stochastic discount factor or pricing kernel). Using
the deﬁnition of covariance and the fact that E½Mtþ1  ¼ 1=Rft ; we can rewrite this
ﬁrst-order condition as
Et ½Rtþ1  Rft  ¼ Rft Covt ½Mtþ1 ; Rtþ1  Rft 

ð18Þ

5

and solve for the Sharpe ratio:
Et ½Rtþ1  Rft 
Stdt ½Rtþ1 

Rft 

¼ Rft Stdt ½Mtþ1  Corrt ½Mtþ1 ; Rtþ1  Rft :

ð19Þ

5
This deﬁnition of the Sharpe ratio is not quite comparable to St ¼ mt =st because it involves gross
returns as opposed to continuously compounded returns. However, the difference is negligible for short

This last equation illustrates that the log Sharpe ratio inherits the dynamics of the
log risk-free rate, the log volatility of marginal utility growth, and the log correlation
of marginal utility growth with returns (assuming this correlation is negative).
Furthermore, if we parameterize marginal utility growth Mtþ1 ¼ v0 ðCtþ1 Þ=v0 ðCt Þ
and expand around the current consumption level Ct ; we get
Stdt ½Mtþ1 CRRAt Stdt ½ðCtþ1  Ct Þ=Ct ; which shows that the volatility of marginal
utility growth depends to a ﬁrst-order approximation on relative risk aversion
RRAt ¼ Ct v00 ðCt Þ=v0 ðCt Þ and the volatility of consumption growth.
There is an extensive literature on the dynamics of the risk-free rate. In addition,
there are numerous equilibrium asset pricing models in which the level of relative risk
aversion, the volatility of consumption growth, or the correlation between marginal
utility growth and returns vary in a slowly mean-reverting fashion. Models with
changing risk aversion include Constantinides (1990), Campbell and Cochrane
(1999), Bekaert and Grenadier (2001), and Brandt and Wang (2003). Models with
varying volatility of consumption growth include Abel (1988), Kandel and
Stambaugh (1991), Gennotte and Marsh (1993), and Bansal and Yaron (2003).
Finally, Whitelaw (2000) formulates a model with changing correlation between
marginal utility growth and returns. Our statistical approach can be interpreted as a
reduced-form approximation of these equilibrium asset pricing models that can
accommodate two independent sources of time variation in Eq. (19).
2.5. Hypotheses
Based on the latent VAR model for the conditional mean and volatility, we
examine two main hypotheses about the relationship between the two moments. The
ﬁrst hypothesis is about their contemporaneous relationship:
H1: No contemporaneous relationship exists between the conditional mean and
volatility. Formally, in the context of our model, b1 ¼ b2 ¼ 0: From Eqs. (10) and
(11), both the volatility-in-mean effect b1 and the mean-in-volatility effect b2
depend on the correlation r: As a result, this hypothesis is equivalent to r ¼ 0: If
the innovations to the moments are uncorrelated, neither the volatility-in-mean
effect nor the mean-in-volatility effect exists, and the two moments are
contemporaneously unrelated.
The second hypothesis is about the intertemporal relationship between the
conditional mean and volatility. There are two forms of intertemporal relationship in
our model: Granger causality and the reduced-form lag adjustments. Granger
causality refers to whether one variable helps predict future realizations of another
through the off-diagonal elements of the transition matrix A: Despite its name,
Granger causality refers to a forecasting relationship and does not identify a
structural relationship or a direction of causality. In contrast, the lag-volatility-inmean and lag-mean-in-volatility effects do shed light on the structural relationship
between the two conditional moments, indicating whether the lagged volatility enters
the reduced-form mean dynamics (10) and whether the lagged mean enters the

ARTICLE IN PRESS
228

reduced-form volatility dynamics (11), respectively. These lag adjustments depend
not only on the off-diagonal elements of A but also on the correlation r: The second
hypothesis is:
H2: There exists no lag-volatility-in-mean and/or lag-mean-in-volatility effect, meaning a12  b1 a22 ¼ 0 and/or a21  b2 a11 ¼ 0: If we fail to reject this hypothesis, the
mean adjusts instantaneously to changes in the volatility and vice versa.
Otherwise, there exists an intertemporal relationship between the two moments
through the lag adjustments.

3. Econometric approach
Eqs. (1) and (2) make up a state-space model. In the terminology of state-space
models, the ﬁrst equation is the measurement or observation equation and the
second equation is the transition or state equation. To draw inferences about both
the parameters of the VAR and the realizations of the latent moments from the
observed returns, we need to solve a sequence of ﬁltering and smoothing
problems. Filtering generates the one-step-ahead forecasts of the latent
variables E½ln mt ; ln st jy1 ; y; yt  and the corresponding forecast variances
Var½ln mt ; ln st jy1 ; y; yt ; which in a linear Gaussian state-space model are used to
construct the likelihood function. Smoothing yields the full-information forecasts of
the latent variables E½ln mt ; ln st jy1 ; y; yT  and the corresponding forecast variances
Var½ln mt ; ln st jy1 ; y; yT : Unfortunately, the ﬁltering and smoothing problems
generated by our latent VAR model are nonstandard because of the nonlinearities
in the measurement equation. As a result, the standard Kalman ﬁlter (designed for
linear Gaussian state-space models) cannot be used directly in the estimation of our
model. We instead rely on a simulation-based method for nonlinear and nonGaussian state-space models.
It is convenient for our econometric discussion to reformulate the model slightly.
We deﬁne mt ¼ ln mt and ut ¼ ln st ; so that mt ¼ expfmt g and st ¼ expfut g: We then
de-mean the latent processes and, with some abuse of our previous notation, let mt
and ut denote the de-meaned moments. Finally, we deﬁne st ¼ ½mt ; ut 0 ; Z1 ¼ ½1; 00 ;
and Z2 ¼ ½0; 10 : With this revised notation, we write Eqs. (1) and (2) as follows:

y ¼ ½s0 ; s1 ; y; sT1 0 :
3.1. Estimation
We estimate the latent VAR model by SML. In particular, we numerically
construct the likelihood function of the model using an importance sampling
approach similar to the one Durbin and Koopman (1997) and Sandmann and
Koopman (1998) use for estimating SV models.
3.1.1. Motivation
The likelihood function of the model is
LðcÞ ¼ pðy j cÞ
Z
¼
pðy; y j cÞ dy
Z
¼
pðy j y; cÞpðy j cÞ dy:

ð24Þ

The ﬁrst line of Eq. (24) deﬁnes the likelihood function as the density of the observed
returns y given the parameters c: The second line expresses this density as the
marginal density of the joint distribution of the observed returns y and the
unobserved state variables y ¼ ½m; v: Finally, in the third line we write the joint
density of y and y as the product of the conditional density of y given y and the
marginal density of y:
The point of this algebra is to illustrate that for a given parameter vector c; the
likelihood function LðcÞ can be viewed as an expectation of the conditional
density pðyjy; cÞ with respect to the marginal density pðyjcÞ: With T data points
and two latent state variables, this expectation involves a 2T-dimensional integral.
The high dimensionality of this integral and the nonlinearities in the conditional
density pðyjy; cÞ make the likelihood function practically impossible to compute
analytically.
In principle, the latent state histories y can be sampled directly from the density
pðyjcÞ and Monte Carlo integration can then be used to solve the integral in Eq. (24).
In practice, however, this brute-force simulation approach is grossly inefﬁcient. We
can greatly improve the efﬁciency of the Monte Carlo integration through the use of
importance sampling. To explain how importance sampling works in our context, we
rewrite the likelihood function in Eq. (24) as follows:
Z
pðy j cÞ
LðcÞ ¼
pðy j y; cÞ
gðy j y; cÞ dy
gðy j y; cÞ



pðy j cÞ
¼ Eg pðy j y; cÞ
;
ð25Þ
gðy j y; cÞ
where gðyjy; cÞ; the so-called importance density, is a conditional density of y
that is not the same as the conditional density pðyjy; cÞ generated by the model,

ARTICLE IN PRESS
230

and Eg ½ denotes an expectation taken with respect to this importance
density.
If gðyjcÞ ¼ pðyjcÞ; the distribution of the latent y is the same under the two models
(though the distribution of y given y may be very different), and
gðy; y j cÞ gðy j y; cÞ gðy j cÞ gðy j y; cÞpðy j cÞ

gðy j y; cÞ gðy j y; cÞ

ð27Þ

where gðyjcÞ  Lg ðcÞ is the likelihood function of the model gðyjy; cÞ: Finally,
substituting Eq. (27) into Eq. (25), we have






Lg ðcÞ
pðy j y; cÞ
LðcÞ ¼ Eg pðy j y; cÞ
¼ Lg ðcÞEg
:
ð28Þ
gðy j y; cÞ
gðy j y; cÞ
In summary, the true likelihood function LðcÞ can be expressed as the product of
the likelihood function Lg ðcÞ of the model gðyjy; cÞ; which we call the
approximating model, and a correction factor Eg ½wðy; cÞ; where for notational
convenience we deﬁne
pðy j y; cÞ
:
ð29Þ
wðy; cÞ ¼
gðy j y; cÞ
The correction factor characterizes the departure of the true likelihood from the
likelihood of the approximating model as the average distance between the
conditional densities pðy j y; cÞ and gðy j y; cÞ: If the two conditional densities are
close to each other for all y; the function wðy; cÞ is close to one and so is its
expectation with respect to gðyjy; cÞ:
The importance density gðy j y; cÞ can in principle be any density of y; given y and
c; that is positive everywhere, satisﬁes the restriction gðy j cÞ ¼ pðy j cÞ; and for
which Eg ½wðy; cÞ exists. The main idea of our econometric approach is to choose an
approximating model for which we can conveniently compute both the likelihood
function Lg ðcÞ and the correction factor Eg ½wðy; cÞ: We can then evaluate the
likelihood function LðcÞ using Eq. (28).
Before we present the approximating model, note that in choosing an importance
density for computational convenience alone we depart from the usual approach in
the literature of considering also the statistical properties of the resulting ratio of
densities wðy; cÞ: Geweke (1989) shows that for the variance of this ratio to be ﬁnite,
the tails of the density in the numerator must be fatter than the tails of the density in
the denominator. In contrast to other applications of importance sampling, our
choice of approximating model is likely to not satisfy this condition. We return to
this issue in Section 3.4.
3.1.2. Approximating model
We choose gðy j y; cÞ to be the conditional density of a linear Gaussian state-space
model that closely approximates our nonlinear model. For example, in the case

and the parameters ct and Rt are calibrated such that the densities gðy j y; cÞ of the
linearized model approximate well the true densities pðy j y; cÞ (the appendices
provide more details). The virtue of this linear measurement equation is that,
together with the linear transition Eq. (21), it implies a linear Gaussian state-space
model for which we can analytically evaluate the likelihood function Lg ðcÞ using the
Kalman ﬁlter algorithm.
3.1.3. Likelihood evaluation
Given a realization of the state history y; we can easily evaluate the conditional
densities pðy j y; cÞ and gðy j y; cÞ and hence also the function wðy; cÞ: However, y is
unobserved and the expectation Eg ½wðy; cÞ cannot be computed analytically. We
therefore use simulations to compute this correction factor. Speciﬁcally, we sample
N state histories yi ; for i ¼ 1; 2; y; N; from the importance density gðy j y; cÞ and use
these samples to construct the ratios

Finally, we deﬁne our SML estimator, c;
bias-corrected approximation of the log likelihood function.
One drawback of constructing the log likelihood of our model as the sum of the
log likelihood of the approximating model and the log correction factor is that we
cannot directly compute the contribution of each observation yt to the likelihood
function. This is because both terms in the sum are evaluated for the whole sample y:
As a result, we cannot compute outer-product based standard errors to check the
validity of the second-derivative based standard errors we use for drawing
asymptotic inferences.
3.2. State variable extraction
Analogous to the simulation-based construction of the correction factor, we
compute the smoothed estimates of the unobserved state variables st ¼ ½mt ; ut 0 as
follows:
E½st j y; c ¼

N
1 X
wi sit ;
N i¼1

ð38Þ

where sit is the tth element of yi from the ith draw from the importance density.
The smoothed estimates of the state variables st are based on the entire sample of
returns y instead of on the returns up to date t (ﬁltered estimates). Unfortunately,
our estimation approach does not readily produce ﬁltered estimates of the state
variables because the draws yi are obtained from the full-sample importance density
gðy j y; cÞ: The practical implication is that our approach is more suitable for ex post
description of the data than for ‘‘on-line’’ signal extraction in a portfolio choice
context, for example.
3.3. Identification and numerical implementation
As with most nonlinear models, it is difﬁcult, if not impossible, to prove that the
parameters of our model are uniquely identiﬁed. In order to minimize the chance of
reporting a local or nonunique global maximum, we implement the following
procedure. We optimize the likelihood from a variety of sensible (according to the
literature and the data) initial parameter guesses for m;
% s;
% A; b11 ; and b22 ; and for a
grid of correlations r; rm ; and rs ; each ranging independently from 0:8 to 0:8: For
each set of initial parameter values, we iterate between applying a simplex algorithm
and a gradient-based algorithm, where each optimization round is started with the
outcome of the previous round, until the criterion function does not improve from
one optimization round to the next. We choose as our estimates the parameters that
correspond to the greatest likelihood and verify that the parameters that correspond

ARTICLE IN PRESS

233

to slightly inferior local maxima are qualitatively similar to our estimates. The
reason for considering a grid of initial values for the correlations is that, intuitively,
nonzero correlations are the most likely cause of identiﬁcation problems. We are
particularly concerned about the case rm a0 and rs a0; but have not experienced any
clear signs of identiﬁcation problems (although the likelihood function is not
particularly sensitive to the value of rm ).
We are also concerned about the accuracy of the approximation of the likelihood
function because a global maximum of an approximated likelihood function is only
as good as the approximation. Therefore, we use a large simulation size of N ¼
10; 000 (typical applications of SML with importance sampling use no more than 500
simulations) and, following the suggestion of Durbin and Koopman (1997), also use
the method of antithetic variates to further reduce the variance of the simulation
errors.6 In addition, we verify for rm ¼ rs ¼ 0 that increasing the number of
simulations to 50,000 does not signiﬁcantly change the SML estimates. Unfortunately, estimating the other speciﬁcations with more simulations is infeasible due to
the dimensionality of the grid of starting values.
3.4. Finite simulation and sample size properties
The asymptotic distribution of our estimator for a ﬁnite simulation size N is
unknown. To make matters worse, our estimator suffers from the critique of
Shephard (2000), that the ratio of densities wðy; cÞ may not have a ﬁnite variance. If
the density in the denominator has thinner tails than the density in the numerator
(which is likely to be the case because we are approximating an unconditionally fattailed SV model with a Gaussian model), extreme draws of yi may cause wi to be
unboundedly large. If the ratio of densities does not have a ﬁnite variance, the
central limit theorem does not apply to the Monte Carlo integral w% and there is no
way to tell how far a given w% is from its expectation.
To determine the severity of this ﬁnite simulation size problem, we follow the
suggestion of Shephard (2000) to simulate a long series of wi ratios and then compute
the variances of wi for the ﬁrst 500 through 75,000 simulations. If this recursive
variance is very sensitive to individual draws and does not converge to some constant
level for very large N; the problem is serious. If, however, the recursive variance
settles down quickly to a constant level, we can be more conﬁdent in our estimator
for a ﬁnite simulation size.
Fig. 1 presents two recursive variance plots for the model with rm ¼ rs ¼ 0: To see
how the properties of the density ratios differ across the likelihood surface, we
evaluate the ratios in Panel A at a representative set of starting values and in Panel B
at the estimates presented in the empirical section. In both cases, the variance of the
density ratios is very sensitive to individual draws for relatively small N:
Furthermore, for the initial parameters, the variance is not only much larger in
magnitude than for the SML estimates (by a factor of about 300), but it also keeps
6

Durbin and Koopman (1997) show how to compute the contribution of the simulations to the
asymptotic variance of the SML estimates. In our case, this contribution is less than 1%.

drifting upward as N increases. This conﬁrms Shephard’s suspicion that the variance
may be unbounded. For the SML estimates, in contrast, the variance seems to be
fairly stable after 10,000 simulations (at least in this particular set of simulations),
ﬂuctuating from 0.209 to 0.227. This also conﬁrms Shephard’s observation in the
context of SV models that the ratio of densities is much better behaved at the SML
estimates than at other points on the likelihood surface.
Although these recursive variance plots are only indicative of the (lack of)
problems induced by evaluating the correction factor with a ﬁnite number of
simulations, we proceed by assuming that the asymptotic distribution of the
estimator is Gaussian as usual. In doing so, we are likely to understate the true
standard errors of our estimates for two reasons. First, the sampling variation of the
Monte Carlo integral for a ﬁnite N (which is 1=N times the variance in Panel B of
Fig. 1) increases the standard errors. Second, the poor sampling properties of the
density ratios may severely deteriorate the asymptotic approximation.

As an alternative way to get a sense for the ﬁnite sample properties of the SML
estimator, we conduct a Monte Carlo experiment. In particular, we repeatedly
estimate the model with rm ¼ rs ¼ 0 and with N ¼ 5000 from 500 independent
samples of T ¼ 636 monthly returns simulated from the model with parameter
values that correspond to the estimates presented in the empirical section. Table 1
presents the results. It shows the true parameter values in the ﬁrst column and
describes the sampling distribution of the corresponding parameter estimates in the
remaining columns. The average and median estimates are all close to the true
parameter values, suggesting that the estimator is relatively unbiased. Furthermore,
except for a21 and a12 ; the standard deviations of the estimates across samples are
small. In particular, the correlation between the innovations to the conditional
moments r; which is central to our ﬁrst hypothesis, is measured very precisely with a
true value of 0:634; an average estimate of 0:636; and a standard deviation of
only 0.071 across samples. The estimates of a21 and a12 ; which are important for our
second hypothesis, are less precise with true values of 0:053 and 0:108 and
estimates ranging from 0:295 to 0.181 with a mean of 0:064 and from 0:109 to
0.320 with a mean of 0.109, respectively. Finally, notice that some of the sampling
distributions are quite skewed, especially for the diagonal elements of A and for r;
raising serious concerns about asymptotic normal approximations.

4. Empirical results
4.1. Data
We study monthly returns on the value-weighted CRSP index in excess of the onemonth Treasury bill rate from January 1946 through December 1998 (636
observations). For the purposes of robustness and speciﬁcation testing, we also
consider three information variables known to be correlated with expected returns
and volatility: the short rate, term premium, and default premium.7 The short rate is
the yield of a one-month Treasury bill. The term premium is the yield spread of a
ten-year Treasury bond and a one-year Treasury bill. Finally, the default premium is
the yield spread of corporate bonds with Moody’s Baa and Aaa rating. Table 2
presents summary statistics of the data. Fig. 2 plots the series and indicates the dates
of all business cycle peaks (dashed lines) and troughs (dotted lines) obtained from the
National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

assumptions about the correlation between the return innovations and the

In particular, subsets of these predictors are used by Keim and Stambaugh (1986), Campbell (1987),
Fama and French (1989), and Ang and Bekaert (2001) to model expected returns and by Campbell (1987),
Schwert (1989), Glosten et al. (1993), and Whitelaw (1994) to model volatility.

Data
This table presents descriptive statistics of monthly returns on the value-weighted CRSP index in excess of
the one-month Treasury bill rate as well as of the short rate, term premium, and default premium from
January 1946 through December 1998. The short rate is the yield on a one-month Treasury bill, the term
premium is the yield spread of a ten-year Treasury bond and a one-year Treasury bill, and the default
premium is the yield spread of Moody’s Baa- and Aaa-rated bonds.

conditional mean and volatility innovations. Model A assumes that these
innovations are uncorrelated. In Models B and C, the return innovations are
allowed to be correlated either with the conditional mean or the conditional
volatility innovations, respectively. Finally, Model D is unrestricted.
The estimates of m% and s% (together with the estimates of b11 and b22 ) imply
an annualized unconditional risk premium of 7.5–7.8% and a return volatility of
13.2–13.6%, which, not surprisingly, match closely the sample moments in Table 2.8
All but one of the estimates of the own-lag persistence coefﬁcients a11 and a22 exceed
0.85 (the exception is a11 in Model B), suggesting that both the conditional mean and
volatility are highly persistent quantities.
The innovations to the conditional mean and volatility are contemporaneously
negatively correlated in all models, with a correlation r that ranges from 0:635 to
0:458 and that is statistically signiﬁcant at any conventional signiﬁcance level. (The
t-statistics are computed with Hessian-based standard error.) This ﬁnding implies a
strong rejection of hypothesis H1. Furthermore, the negative sign implies that the
unconditional return distribution is negatively skewed (consistent with Table 2) and
that both the volatility-in-mean
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃand mean-in-volatility effects are negative and
signiﬁcant, with b1 ¼ r b11 =b22 ranging from 0:235 to 0:155 and b2 ¼

We compute the unconditional moments of returns using the properties of bi-variate log-normal
random variables and the unconditional mean and covariance matrix of the log moments in Eq. (4).

Fig. 2. Returns and predictors. This ﬁgure plots the monthly returns on the value-weighted CRSP index in
excess of the one-month Treasury bill rate as well as of the short rate, term premium, and default premium

dates of the peak and trough of every business cycle in the sample, respectively.

r b22 =b11 ranging from 1:998 to 1:352: It is clear that there exists a negative
contemporaneous trade-off between expected returns and risk, which conﬁrms the
results of Campbell (1987), Breen et al. (1989), Nelson (1991), and Glosten et al.
(1993), but not those of French et al. (1987) and Campbell and Hentschel (1992).
The off-diagonal elements of the transition matrix a12 and a21 ; which determine
the Granger causality embedded in the VAR, are individually not signiﬁcant at the
5% level (but a12 is signiﬁcant at the 10% level in Models A and C). To determine
whether these parameters are also jointly insigniﬁcant, we estimate the models under
the restriction a12 ¼ a21 ¼ 0 and conduct a likelihood ratio (LR) test of the
restriction. The LR test statistics, which are asymptotically w2 distributed with two
degrees of freedom, all exceed the 1% critical value of 9.21. This rejection is evidence
in favor of bidirectional Granger causality between the conditional moments,
meaning the lagged volatility helps predict the mean and, to a somewhat lesser
degree, the lagged mean helps predict the volatility.
The opposite signs of a12 and a21 conﬁrm qualitatively Whitelaw’s (1994) ﬁnding
that the cross-autocorrelations between the conditional mean and volatility offset

each other through time. An increase in the mean is followed by a decrease in the
volatility, while an increase in the volatility leads to a subsequent increase in the
mean. Unfortunately, we cannot directly compare our estimates to Whitelaw’s
results because our VAR is for log moments instead of levels. However, we can
approximate the off-diagonal elements of a VAR in levels by dm=ds ¼
ðd ln m=d ln sÞðm=sÞCa12 m=
% s% and ds=dm ¼ ðd ln s=d ln mÞðs=mÞCa21 s=
% m:
% Whitelaw’s
estimates (for a shorter sample period) are dm=ds ¼ 0:118 and ds=dm ¼ 0:107: Our
approximations range from 0.014 to 0.021 and from 0:784 to 0:160; respectively.
The lag-volatility-in-mean and lag-mean-in-volatility effects are both positive and
signiﬁcant at the 5% level (in most cases even at the 1% level), with estimates of
a12  b1 a22 ranging from 0.238 to 0.325 and those of a21  b2 a11 ranging from 1.103
to 1.604. (The asymptotic standard errors of a12  b1 a22 and a21  b2 a11 are

computed using the delta method.) Therefore, both parts of hypothesis H2 are
decisively rejected and the reduced-form models in Eqs. (10) and (11) feature lag
adjustments. This means that the mean and volatility adjust not only instantaneously
but also with a lag to changes in the other moment.
The rejections of the hypotheses H1 and H2 are based on asymptotic standard
errors. However, as stressed in Section 3.4, the asymptotics of our estimator are
questionable for a number of reasons. To substantiate the evidence on the
contemporaneous correlation and lag adjustments, we conduct a Monte Carlo
experiment under each null. Speciﬁcally, we estimate Model A under each of the
restrictions r ¼ 0; a12 ¼ b1 a22 ; and a21 ¼ b2 a11 : We then simulate from each model
500 independent samples of T ¼ 636 monthly returns and construct sampling
distributions of the restrictions under the null. The results corroborate our asymptotic
inferences. Under the null of r ¼ 0; the estimated correlation is less than 0:5 in only
two of the 500 samples. Likewise, under the null a12 ¼ b1 a22 or a21 ¼ b2 a11 ; the
estimate of a12  b1 a22 or a21  b2 a11 exceed their empirical estimates in less than 3%
and 1% of the samples under the null, respectively. We conclude that the rejections of
H1 and H2 are not attributed to invalid asymptotic approximations.
The estimates of a11 þ a12  a21  a22 range from 0.068 to 0.183 and all have
t-statistics greater than two, suggesting (based on the asymptotics) that the Sharpe
ratio follows a two-factor process. If we use the conditional mean as the second
factor, the own-lag persistence of the Sharpe ratio is a22  a12 C0:80; if we use the
volatility as the second factor, it is a11  a21 C0:90: In either case, the Sharpe ratio is
highly persistent, which reﬂects our ﬁnding above that both the conditional mean
and volatility are highly persistent.
The signs of the estimated correlations rm between the return and mean
innovations (Models B and D), and rs between the return and volatility innovations
(Models C and D), are consistent with the volatility feedback and leverage effects,
respectively. Both correlations are negative, which implies that increases in the mean
and volatility are associated with negative returns. However, only the estimates of rs
are signiﬁcant and, judging by the Akaike information criterion, only Model C yields
an improvement in ﬁt to the fully restricted Model A. (The Akaike information
criterion is deﬁned as AIC ¼ ln L  dim½c:) Since the estimates of rm are
insigniﬁcant and the volatility feedback explanation is consistent with a negative
rs only if r is positive, we conclude that our results favor the leverage explanation of
asymmetric volatility.
Finally, the estimates of the latent VAR and, more importantly, of the reducedform models in Eqs. (10) and (11), are remarkably similar across the four correlation
structures. We therefore focus in the remainder of the paper on Model C, the bestﬁtting model according to the Akaike information criterion. However, we veriﬁed
that all qualitative statements we make below are robust to this speciﬁcation choice.
4.3. Time-series of the conditional moments
Given the parameter estimates in Table 3 and the index returns, we extract
estimates of the conditional mean, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. Before we study the

ARTICLE IN PRESS

241

time series of these estimates, we ﬁrst consider as a point of reference the time series
of the returns themselves. It is clear from Table 2 that the returns are noisy, with an
annualized volatility of 14% and a ﬁrst-order autocorrelation of only 0.035. It is
therefore not surprising that in Fig. 2 the noise disguises the persistence of the
conditional mean. The persistence of the conditional volatility is more apparent.
Judging by the frequency and magnitude of large price changes, there are
pronounced and prolonged periods of high and low volatility.
The left column of Fig. 3 presents the smoothed estimates of the annualized (not
logged) mean (ﬁrst row), volatility (second row), and Sharpe ratio (third row). Each
plot also shows as vertical lines the dates of all business cycle peaks (dashed lines)
and troughs (dotted lines) in our sample. It is immediately clear that both the
conditional mean and volatility vary through time. The annualized mean has a
standard deviation of 0.9% and ranges from 4.8% in 1965 to almost 10% in 1988.
The annualized volatility has a standard deviation of 4.5% percent and ranges from
less than 5% in 1965 to over 30% in 1987. Consistent with the estimates of a11 and
a22 ; the conditional mean reverts faster to its long-term average than the conditional
volatility. In fact, periods of high or low volatility appear to last as long as a few
decades.
To gauge the statistical signiﬁcance of the variation of the conditional mean and
volatility, we estimate restricted models with either constant mean or constant
volatility and then perform LR tests of these restrictions. Both constrained models
can be rejected at the 5% level (asymptotic p-values of 2.3% for the constant-mean
model and less than 0.5% for the constant-volatility model). To measure economic
signiﬁcance and to relate our results to the literature on time-varying moments, we
also compute the statistics 1  Var½yt  mt =Var½yt  and 1  Var½y2t  s2t =Var½y2t ;
which we interpret as predictive regression R2 ’s for returns and squared returns,
respectively. The values of these statistics, 2.1% for returns and 35.7% for squared
returns, are comparable to the results of predicting monthly returns with exogenous
predictors and squared returns with ARCH models.
The variation of the conditional mean is distinctly countercyclical. In eight of the
nine completed business cycles in the sample, the conditional mean rises almost
monotonically from the peak (dotted vertical lines) to the trough (dashed vertical
lines) of the cycle (the only exception is the 1948–1949 recession). Although other
studies have found similar countercyclical patterns in the conditional mean (Fama
and French, 1989), the strength of our ﬁnding is astonishing given the fact that we
are not using exogenous predictors. The problem with using exogenous predictors to
identify cyclical patterns is that the NBER may use the same predictors (or variables
that are highly correlated with these predictors) to ex post date the peaks and
troughs of the business cycles. Furthermore, it is interesting that although the
periods between the peaks and troughs of the business cycles are aligned with the
expected return cycles, the sometimes much longer periods between a trough and
the following peak often contain more than one large swing in expected returns.
The conditional volatility exhibits a somewhat different cyclical pattern. In
particular, the volatility is almost uniformly high and at times decreasing during
recessions, when the conditional mean is rising, and low during expansions.

ARTICLE IN PRESS
242

M.W. Brandt, Q. Kang / Journal of Financial Economics 72 (2004) 217–257

However, this business cycle pattern is distorted by low-frequency swings in
volatility that last for decades.
To quantify the patterns in the variation of the conditional moments, we compute
the differences between the means and volatilities at the trough and preceding peak
of each business cycle. To smooth some of the month-to-month ﬂuctuations in the
moments, we work with the average moments over the three months straddling
the peak or trough. For the mean, all but one of the differences are positive and the
average difference is 1.1%. If the means were independent and identically distributed
(iid), which is a very conservative
pﬃﬃﬃ assumption
pﬃﬃﬃ given their persistence, the standard
error of this difference is
2  0:9= 9 ¼ 0:4%, indicating that the average
difference is signiﬁcant at the 5% level. For the volatility, all differences are
negative and the average difference
pﬃﬃﬃ is 4:9%
pﬃﬃﬃ with a standard error (under the
conservative iid assumption) of 2  4:5= 9 ¼ 2:1%. In addition, we compute
correlations between the moments and the three exogenous conditioning variables.
The univariate correlations of the conditional mean with the short rate, term
premium, and default premium are 0.192, 0:021; and 0.498, respectively, and a
multivariate R2 is 0.319. The correlations of the conditional volatility with the same
variables are 0.252, 0:238; and 0:256; and the R2 is 0.132. These statistics illustrate
at least two facts. First, the mean is highly correlated with the empirically and
theoretically countercyclical default spread. Second, the volatility is much less
correlated with the predictors than the mean, which is fairly standard in the literature
(as long as the predictors exclude lagged volatilities).
The only seemingly counterfactual feature of our estimates is that the conditional
mean is weakly positively correlated with the short rate, while predictive return
regressions suggest a negative correlation. We conjecture that this result is due to the
fact that our estimates are strongly cyclical and do not exhibit a pattern that
resembles the almost monotonic rise of the short rate from the 1940s through the
early 1980s and then subsequent drop through the late 1990s (see Fig. 2). To verify
this conjecture, we relate the conditional mean to the difference between the short
rate and its one-year moving average (which essentially detrends the short rate).
Consistent with predictive return regressions, the resulting univariate correlation is
0:22: Furthermore, we run a multivariate regression of the conditional mean on all
three predictors (which also detrends the short rate if the predictors are
cointegrated). The regression coefﬁcient on the short rate is 0:012 with a t-statistic
of 8:46:
Together, the countercyclical variation of the mean and the increase in volatility
during recessions leads to countercyclical variation of the conditional Sharpe ratio.
The Sharpe ratio rises from the peak to the trough of every completed business cycle
in the sample. This countercyclical variation of the Sharpe ratio is consistent with the
intuition from habit formation models (Constantinides, 1990; Campbell and
Cochrane, 1999). At the peak of a business cycle, consumers are enjoying
consumption levels far above their historically built-up ‘‘habits’’ which makes them
relatively risk-tolerant. As a result, a low expected reward per unit of risk, or low
Sharpe ratio, is required for consumers to invest in stocks at the peak of a cycle. At
the trough of a cycle, in contrast, consumption levels are approaching the habits (or

ARTICLE IN PRESS
M.W. Brandt, Q. Kang / Journal of Financial Economics 72 (2004) 217–257

243

perceived subsistence levels), which makes consumers relatively risk averse. For
consumers to invest in stocks at the trough, the Sharpe ratio must be high.
Fig. 3 offers a more visual description of how the lead-lag interactions between the
conditional mean and volatility arise. As the economy comes off the peak of a
business cycle, the volatility rises almost immediately. The mean, however, increases
only gradually as the economy moves from the peak to the trough of the cycle.
Therefore, the volatility appears to lead the mean through the recession. The mean
then reaches a high at the trough of the cycle, shortly after which the volatility drops
back to its lower expansion level. As a result, the increase in the mean is associated
with a subsequent drop in the volatility.

4.4. Impulse response functions
To better understand the dynamic behavior of the conditional moments, we now
turn to the impulse response functions of the VAR. The impulse response functions
show how a one standard deviation shock to one of the innovations of the VAR
affects contemporaneously the conditional mean and volatility and then propagates
to future realizations of the moments through the dynamic structure of the VAR.
Since our model describes the dynamics of the log mean and log volatility, we
transform the impulse response functions of the VAR into the implied impulse
response functions for the mean and volatility (without logs).
As long as the innovations of the VAR are uncorrelated, interpreting the impulse
response functions is straightforward. The innovation to the mean is Z1t and the
innovation to the volatility is Z2t : However, the innovations of the VAR are usually
correlated, which means that Z1t and Z2t have a common component that acts on
both the mean and volatility, and two orthogonal components that act only on the
mean or the volatility, respectively. Since we cannot identify all three components
separately, we follow the convention to attribute the common component of the
innovations to Z1t (simply because it belongs to the ﬁrst equation of the VAR) and to
remove this common component from Z2t ; so that this second innovation is by
construction orthogonal to the ﬁrst. Mechanically, we use a Cholesky decomposition
of the error covariance matrix to orthogonalize the innovations of the VAR. The
impulse response functions then trace the effects of a one standard deviation shock
to the common component (which contemporaneously acts on the mean and, to the
extent that the original innovations are correlated, also on the volatility) and to
the orthogonal component (which by construction acts contemporaneously only on
the volatility).
The six plots in Fig. 4 illustrate the impulse responses for the unrestricted VAR
(solid lines) and the restricted VAR with a12 ¼ a21 ¼ 0 (dashed lines). The ﬁrst
column of plots shows the effects of a one standard deviation mean innovation at
date t on the mean (ﬁrst row), the volatility (second row), and the Sharpe ratio (third
row) at dates t; t þ 1; y; t þ 60: Similarly, the second column shows the effects of a
one standard deviation orthogonalized volatility innovation on the current and
future mean, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.

Fig. 4. Impulse response functions. This ﬁgure plots the contemporaneous and lagged responses of the
conditional mean, volatility, and Sharpe ratio to a one standard deviation mean innovation (in Panel A)
and a one standard deviation orthogonalized volatility innovation (in Panel B) for Model C. The solid and
dashed lines correspond to unrestricted and restricted ða21 ¼ a12 ¼ 0Þ estimates.

Consider ﬁrst the impulse responses for the unrestricted VAR. The ﬁrst column
of plots illustrates clearly the negative contemporaneous correlation between
the conditional mean and volatility. A one standard deviation mean innovation

ARTICLE IN PRESS
246

results in a contemporaneous 0.66% increase in the annualized mean, a 1.76%
decrease in the annualized volatility, and a 0.14 increase in the annualized
Sharpe ratio. Thereafter, the mean fully mean-reverts within four months and
then overshoots its long-term average by dropping as much as an additional
0.29% over the next 24 months. The explanation for this overshooting of the
mean after a positive mean innovation is the lag adjustment of the mean to
the change in volatility. The volatility keeps dropping, although at a decreasing
rate, for about 24 months after the mean innovation. This persistent drop in
volatility causes the mean to fall due to the positive and relatively large
Granger causality term a12 as well as the positive lag-volatility-in-mean effect
a12  b1 a22 : The three plots also illustrate clearly the persistence of the conditional moments. One year after the shock, the conditional mean and volatility
are still 0.22% and 0.68% away from their respective long-term averages,
respectively.
The second column illustrates that much of the variation of the conditional
volatility is contemporaneously independent of the variation of the conditional
mean. A one standard deviation orthogonalized volatility innovation immediately
leads to a 3% increase in the annualized volatility. Since the volatility is highly
persistent, it returns to its long-term average only about 18 months after
the innovation. The lag adjustment of the conditional mean to changes in the
volatility is also more pronounced for the orthogonalized volatility innovation
because by construction the mean does not react contemporaneously to this
innovation. The response of the mean to the orthogonalized volatility innovation
is hump-shaped. The mean does not respond contemporaneously but rises
immediately after the innovation and peaks six months later at a level of 0.5%
above its long-term average. The mean then mean-reverts to its long-term average
over the following 30 months. Notice that even after the volatility fully mean-reverts,
the mean is still relatively high with a normal level of risk. This results in an aboveaverage Sharpe ratio from 12 through 36 months after the orthogonalized volatility
innovation.
An intuitive way to illustrate the role of the lag adjustments in the dynamics of
the conditional mean and volatility is to compare the impulse responses of the
restricted VAR with a21 ¼ a21 ¼ 0 (dashed lines) to those of the unrestricted VAR
(solid lines). Consider ﬁrst the responses of the restricted VAR to a one standard
deviation mean innovation. Although the initial effect of the innovation is virtually
the same as in the unrestricted VAR, the mean fully mean-reverts within one
year and, more importantly, does not overshoot its long-term average. The reason
for this difference in mean responses is that in the restricted VAR, the decrease
in volatility (from the mean innovation) does not feed back to the mean in future
periods. This lack of feedback is even more transparent for a one standard
deviation orthogonalized volatility innovation, where in the restricted VAR the
mean never responds to the innovation. It is therefore clear from Fig. 4 that the lag
adjustments of the mean to changes in volatility and, to a lesser extent, of the
volatility to changes in the mean, play an important role in the dynamics of the
conditional moments.

4.5. A closer look at the contemporaneous correlation
There is a surprising amount of disagreement about even the sign of the
contemporaneous correlation between the conditional mean and volatility of stock
returns. Our results contribute to this empirical debate by documenting a strong
negative correlation between the innovations to the conditional mean and volatility,
which in turn implies negative and substantial volatility-in-mean and mean-involatility effects. However, on the face of it, our analysis is subject to the caveat that
we model the log moments, while most of the literature relates the mean and
volatility directly (without logs).
To establish a tighter link to the literature, notice that the log moments ln mt and
ln st are bivariate normally distributed. The moments mt and st are therefore
bivariate log-normally distributed. It follows from the bivariate log-normal
distribution that

for sufﬁciently small b11 and b22 : In words, we can legitimately approximate the
correlation between the conditional mean and volatility by the correlation between
the corresponding log moments. Given the parameter estimates in Table 3, the
approximation error is only 0.012 (0:557 with logs versus 0:545 without logs). We
conclude that despite the log transformation, our empirical results can be interpreted
readily in the context of the literature on the contemporaneous correlation between
the conditional mean and volatility.
However, not only can our results be interpreted in the context of this literature,
but they actually shed light on why there is such disagreement about the sign of
the contemporaneous correlation. The key issue is the distinction between the
conditional (on ln mt1 and ln st1 ) and unconditional correlation between the
moments. The conditional correlation is the same as the correlation between
the innovations to the moments and is equal to r: The unconditional correlation, in
contrast, is computed from the unconditional covariance matrix in Eq. (4). It is clear
from this equation that, depending on A; the conditional and unconditional
correlations can be quite different.
Fig. 5 illustrates this point by plotting the unconditional cross-autocorrelations (as
opposed to the conditional cross-autocorrelations implicit in the impulse response
functions) of the mean and volatility implied by the parameter estimates in Table 3,
where the ‘‘offset’’ represents the number of months the volatility is lagged (negative
offset) or led (positive offset) relative to the mean. Each of the unconditional crossautocorrelations is computed from the corresponding unconditional auto-covariance
matrices of the VAR. For example, the unconditional contemporaneous correlation,
at an offset of zero, is computed from the unconditional covariance matrix in Eq. (4).
The unconditional cross-correlations between the mean and leads of the volatility
of more than 12 months are all negative, with a minimum of 0:09 at an offset of 21
months. In contrast, the correlations are positive for all lagged values of the volatility

as well as for led values up to an offset of 12 months. The correlations decay with
both increasingly negative and positive offsets, but the decay is asymmetric due to
the differences between the off-diagonal elements of A: The cross-correlations peak
at an offset of minus six months with 0.75, which means that unconditionally the
volatility leads the mean by six months. It is interesting to note that the average
duration of a recession in our sample is approximately nine months. The six-month
lead of the volatility therefore seems to relate to the business cycle pattern in the
conditional moments that we documented in Section 4.3. The increase in volatility at
the beginning of the recession is associated with an (almost certain) increase in the
mean approximately six months later, toward the end of the recession.
The most important result for understanding the apparent disagreement about the
sign of the contemporaneous correlation is that, although the conditional
contemporaneous correlation is large and negative ð0:557Þ; the unconditional
contemporaneous correlation (at an offset of zero) is large and positive (0.312). This
positive unconditional correlation arises both because of the large and positive
Granger causality term a12 ; which implies a large and positive lag-volatility-in-mean
effect, and because of the high persistence of the volatility. For example, suppose the
volatility increases from a normal 15% to 25% (as the economy enters a recession).
Over the following few months the mean increases gradually, reaching its highest
level about six months after the increase in volatility. Since the volatility is highly
persistent, it is still relatively high (23%, for example) even six months after the
initial increase. Therefore, it appears unconditionally that whenever the mean is high
the volatility is also high, suggesting a positive correlation between the moments.
This ﬁnding implies that the sign and magnitude of the contemporaneous
correlation between the conditional mean and volatility depends crucially on
whether we measure the conditional or unconditional correlation. It is not surprising
then that the results about the contemporaneous correlation in the literature depend
on the statistical model and predictors (Harvey, 2001; Koopman and Uspensky,
1999), the return horizon (Harrison and Zhang, 1999), and, most importantly,

ARTICLE IN PRESS

249

whether we measure the correlation in levels or ﬁrst-differences (French et al., 1987;
Whitelaw, 1994).
4.6. Exogenous predictors
On the one hand, the advantage of our latent VAR approach is that it allows us to
study the dynamics of the conditional mean and volatility without relying on
exogenous predictors. On the other hand, by ignoring the evidence of a correlation
between the conditional moments and exogenous predictors, we are potentially
discarding some useful information. Discarding information is always undesirable,
but it is particularly so in this application because, judging by the vast disagreement
in the literature, precisely measuring the relationship between the conditional mean
and volatility is difﬁcult.
As a compromise and robustness check, we therefore estimate an extended version
of the model in which each moment can also depend on three variables known to be
correlated with expected returns and volatility: the short rate, term premium, and
default premium (see footnote 7 for references).9 In particular, we assume that these
three variables are truly exogenous and then consider the following model

where xt denotes the de-meaned predictors observed at date t:
The extended transition Eq. (41) can be interpreted directly in the context of the
predictability (of both the mean and volatility) literature. With A ¼ 0; the ﬁrst
equation of the extended VAR resembles a predictive regression (except for the log)
and the second equation is an EGARCH model with only exogenous predictors.
Without this restriction, both the exogenous predictors xt and the lagged moments
st1 forecast future realizations of the moments st : Furthermore, since the predictors
are de-meaned, the coefﬁcient matrix C shows how deviations of the predictive
variables from their long-term averages predict deviations of the conditional
moments from their long-term averages.
Table 4 reports the estimates of the extended model and also replicates for
comparison the results for Model C in Table 3. The estimates of A and S are quite
similar across the two models. When we add exogenous predictors, the own-lag
coefﬁcients a11 and a22 both increase. The coefﬁcients a12 on the volatility in the
mean equation and a21 on the mean in the volatility equation both decrease in
magnitude. The variance of the mean and volatility decrease, which means that the

Two common volatility predictors, squared returns (French et al., 1987; Schwert, 1989; Schwert and

not included in this list. Squared returns are already implicitly incorporated in our estimation through the
approximating model in Eq. (30) and the availability of option-implied volatilities is too limited to study
business cycle patterns in the conditional moments (covering only one business cycle).

exogenous predictors help explain some of the variation in the moments that was
previously left unexplained. Finally, the contemporaneous correlation between the
innovations to the mean and volatility decreases in magnitude from 0:557 to
0:451: Together, these differences translate into slightly smaller lag-volatility-in-

251

mean and lag-mean-in-volatility effects (0.188 versus 0.252 and 1.044 versus 1.471,
respectively). However, both effects remain signiﬁcant at the 1% level.
In the mean equation of the extended VAR, the coefﬁcients on the term premium
and default premium (c12 and c13 ) are positive and the coefﬁcient on the short rate
ðc11 Þ is negative. In the volatility equation, the coefﬁcients on all three predictors (c21 ;
c22 ; and c23 ) are positive. The signs of the coefﬁcients are consistent with the results
of predictive return and squared return regressions. All estimates are statistically
signiﬁcant at the 5% level and in most cases even at the 1% level. However, it is
important to recognize that these results are not comparable to predictive return or
squared return regressions. Instead, they correspond to regressions with the
conditional moments as dependent variables. As we document above, the conditional
moments are highly correlated with the predictors (multiple R2 of 0.32 for the mean
and 0.13 for the volatility).
Despite the fact that all of the elements of C are statistically signiﬁcant, the overall
ﬁt of the model does not improve substantially when we add the exogenous
predictors. An LR test of the hypothesis C ¼ 0 fails to reject with a p-value of 0.152.
Likewise, a Hausman (1978) test of the hypothesis that the matrix A is the same
across the two models fails to reject at conventional signiﬁcance levels. This failure to
reject suggests that the exogenous predictors do not signiﬁcantly alter the dynamics
of the conditional moments.
The plots on the right-hand side of Fig. 3 present estimates of the annualized mean
(ﬁrst row), volatility (second row), and Sharpe ratio (third row), extracted from the
extended VAR with exogenous predictors. The time variation of the three moments,
especially of the volatility and Sharpe ratio, are remarkably similar across the models
with and without exogenous predictors (correlations of 0.73 for the mean, 0.97 for
the volatility, and 0.91 for the Sharpe ratio). Speciﬁcally, the business cycle pattern in
the variation of the conditional moments is qualitatively unaltered by the exogenous
predictors. If anything, the extended model further emphasizes the countercyclical
variation of the Sharpe ratio. This conﬁrms the statistical evidence above and attests
to the robustness of our empirical results.

5. Conclusion
We model the conditional mean and volatility of stock returns as a latent VAR to
explore both the contemporaneous and intertemporal relationship between the two
moments, as well as the time variation of the implied Sharpe ratio, in a ﬂexible
statistical framework and without relying on exogenous predictors. The ﬁrst
equation of the VAR describes the dynamics of the conditional mean and captures
the temporary component in the permanent and temporary components model. The
second equation describes the dynamics of the conditional volatility and nests the
standard SV model. Finally, the implied Sharpe ratio is time-varying in a way that is
consistent with a variety of equilibrium asset pricing models.
On the contemporaneous relationship between the conditional mean and
volatility, we estimate a strong negative correlation between the innovations to the

ARTICLE IN PRESS

252

two moments, which implies negative and substantial volatility-in-mean and meanin-volatility effects. On the intertemporal relationship, the reduced-form lagvolatility-in-mean and lag-mean-in-volatility effects are both positive and signiﬁcant.
Together, the contemporaneous and intertemporal relationships generate pronounced countercyclical variation of the Sharpe ratio. Every recorded business cycle
in the sample is associated with an almost monotonic rise in the Sharpe ratio from
the peak to the trough of the cycle. We argue that this countercyclical variation of
the Sharpe ratio is consistent with the intuition of habit formation.
We document a systematic pattern in the way the mean and volatility change over
the business cycle. Whenever the economy comes off the peak of a business cycle, the
conditional volatility rises immediately. The conditional mean, however, increases
only gradually as the economy moves from the peak to the trough of the cycle. Thus,
the volatility appears to lead the mean (by about six months) through the recession.
The mean reaches a high at the trough of the cycle, shortly after which the volatility
drops again to a normal level. As a result, the increase in the mean is associated with
a subsequent drop in the volatility.
Despite the large and negative contemporaneous correlation between the
innovations to the conditional mean and volatility, which measures the conditional
(on the lagged mean and volatility) correlation between the moments, the
unconditional contemporaneous correlation between the mean and volatility is
large and positive due to the strong lag-volatility-in-mean effect. Unconditionally,
times of high expected returns are therefore associated with high volatility. We argue
that this difference between the conditional and unconditional correlations may
explain why there is such disagreement about the sign of the contemporaneous
correlation between the two moments.

simulation smoother, simulated values of yt are normally distributed around their
mean y% t : This suggests that the parameters ct and Rt of the approximating model
should be chosen such that the densities pðyjy; cÞ and gðyjy; cÞ are as close as possible
in the neighborhood of y% t :
To operationalize this idea, we deﬁne

and choose ct and Rt such that the ﬁrst- and second-order derivatives of lðy; cÞ with
respect to st are set to zero at yt ¼ y% t : More speciﬁcally, we set rw ¼ 0 and solve for
c1t and R1t from the derivatives of Eqs. (A.2) and (A.4), and for c2t and R2t from the
derivatives of Eqs. (A.3) and (A.5).10

The coefﬁcient rw captures the correlation between a normally-distributed and a log-w2 -distributed
random variable. Our Monte Carlo experiments show that this correlation is very small (less than 0.05),
and we therefore set rw ¼ 0:
