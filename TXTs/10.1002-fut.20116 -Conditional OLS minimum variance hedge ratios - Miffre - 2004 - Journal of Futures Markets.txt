CONDITIONAL OLS
MINIMUM VARIANCE
HEDGE RATIOS
JOËLLE MIFFRE

The paper presents a new methodology to estimate time dependent minimum variance hedge ratios. The so-called conditional OLS hedge ratio
modifies the static OLS approach to incorporate conditioning information. The ability of the conditional OLS hedge ratio to minimize the risk of
a hedged portfolio is compared to conventional static and dynamic
approaches, such as the naïve hedge, the roll-over OLS hedge, and the
bivariate GARCH(1,1) model. The paper concludes that, both in-sample
and out-of-sample, the conditional OLS hedge ratio reduces the basis risk
of an equity portfolio better than the alternatives conventionally used
in risk management. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark

and across a wide cross section of assets.1 Most importantly, the
evidence indicates that conditional asset pricing models with timevarying risk and time-varying factor risk premia capture most of the predictable variance of returns and leave little variation to be explained in
terms of market inefficiency (Ferson & Harvey, 1993; Evans, 1994;
Ferson & Korajczyk, 1995; Harvey, 1995). It follows that the predictability of returns is probably consistent with rational pricing in efﬁcient markets and most likely results from variations in the return required by
investors over time to compensate them for risk and deferred consumption (for an early review see Fama, 1991).
If the predictable variations in returns are rational, hedging strategies that ignore this predictability might lead to suboptimal hedging decisions. The purpose of the paper is to present a new methodology that
takes the predictability of returns into account while estimating time
dependent minimum variance hedge ratios. The approach modiﬁes the
traditional OLS hedge ratio to incorporate conditioning information. It
relies on previous work on conditional asset pricing and on conditional
portfolio performance evaluation (Ferson & Warther, 1996; Ferson &
Schadt, 1996; Christopherson, Ferson, & Glassman, 1998).
This hedge ratio, referred to as the conditional OLS (ordinary least
squares) hedge ratio, presents three advantages compared to the traditional naive, static OLS, and GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity) hedge ratios typically encountered in the literature on hedging. First, unlike the naive hedge ratio, the conditional
OLS hedge ratio recognizes the less than perfect correlation between
spot and futures prices. Second, as opposed to the naive and the static
OLS hedge ratios, the conditional OLS hedge ratio is time dependent. It
takes into account the stochastic movements in hedge ratios arising from
the predictability of returns. Third, the conditional OLS hedge ratio is
simple to estimate and does not suffer from the problems of convergence
one sometimes runs into with the family of GARCH models. Like
GARCH, it readjusts hedging positions as new information becomes
available. However, it does not require the sometimes tedious maximization of the GARCH log likelihood function and produces virtually
instant estimates of the one-step ahead hedge ratio. For these reasons,
the investment community may welcome the conditional OLS hedge
ratio as an alternative tool for risk management.

Among many others, the assets tested for time-varying risk premia include U.S. long-term corporate bonds (Chang & Huang, 1990), international equity indices (Ferson & Harvey, 1993; Harvey,
1995), and futures contracts (Bessembinder & Chan, 1992; Miffre, 2000).

Conditional OLS Minimum Variance Hedge Ratios

The empirical part of the paper attempts to answer the following
questions. Do information variables available at time t  1 capture the
variation in the optimal hedge ratio of an equity portfolio? Does conditioning the hedge ratio on past information enhance hedging effectiveness relative to the alternatives already present in the literature on risk
management? The ability of the conditional OLS hedge ratio to minimize market risk is compared to conventional static and dynamic
approaches, such as the naive hedge, the roll-over OLS hedge, and the
bivariate GARCH(1,1) model. Special attention is given to measuring
portfolio volatility in-sample and out-of-sample. The paper concludes
that information variables available at time t  1 capture the change in
the hedge ratios of an equity portfolio and that the conditional OLS
hedge ratio substantially reduces in-sample and out-of-sample volatility.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. The second section brieﬂy reviews the literature on hedging. The third section presents
the theory that underpins the conditional OLS minimum variance hedge
ratio and describes the methodologies used to estimate competing hedge
ratios. The fourth section introduces the data set. The ﬁfth section presents the empirical results. Finally the last section concludes.
A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
ON HEDGING
Traditionally, three approaches have been suggested as a way to minimize
the risk of a cash position. The ﬁrst one, called the naive or one-to-one
hedge, assumes that the correlation between the spot and the futures
prices is perfect and sets the hedge ratio equal to one over the period of
the hedge. The problems with this hedge ratio are twofold. First, it fails to
recognize that the correlation between spot and futures prices is less than
perfect. Second, it fails to consider the stochastic nature of futures and
spot prices and the resulting time variation in the hedge ratio.
The second approach, the static OLS hedge, accurately recognizes
that the correlation between the futures and spot prices is less than perfect and estimates the hedge ratio as the OLS coefﬁcient of a regression
of spot return on futures return (Ederington, 1979; Figlewski, 1984).
However it imposes the restriction of a constant joint distribution of spot
and futures price changes. As such, it could lead to suboptimal hedging
decisions in periods of high basis volatility. The naive and OLS
approaches are static risk management strategies that involve a one-time
decision about the best hedge and do not require any adjustment of the
hedge ratio once this decision is taken.

More recently, quite a large literature was developed to overcome
the problems inherent in the naïve and static OLS hedge ratios. The
authors who focused on these issues are concerned with the dynamics in
the joint distribution of returns and with the time-varying nature of optimal hedge ratios. Hedge ratios are estimated using the family of GARCH
models introduced by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986). These papers
study a variety of commodities (Baillie & Myers, 1991; Myers, 1991),
Treasury securities (Cecchetti, Cumby, & Figlewski, 1988), foreign
exchange instruments (Kroner & Sultan, 1991, 1993; Lin, Najand, &
Yung, 1994; Gagnon, Lypny, & McCurdy, 1998), and stock indices
(Park & Switzer, 1995; Brooks, Henry, & Persand, 2002). The conclusions that emerge from these studies are that optimal hedge ratios are
time dependent and that dynamic hedging reduces in-sample portfolio
variance substantially better than static hedging. However, the out-ofsample advantages of the GARCH hedge ratio are much more controversial. Some argue that the GARCH hedge ratio enhances out-of-sample
hedging effectiveness (Baillie & Myers, 1991; Kroner & Sultan, 1993;
Park & Switzer, 1995; Brooks, Henry, & Persand, 2002). Others, however, weight the beneﬁts of a dynamic hedge against the extra complexity
of the GARCH method and the transactions costs it involves and conclude that static hedging might reduce ex ante volatility better (Kroner &
Sultan, 1991; Myers, 1991; Lin et al., 1994). This suggests that the
benefits from an active risk management strategy ought to be viewed
with some caution.

METHODOLOGY
The Conditional OLS Hedge Ratio
Consider an investor who is long stocks. He wants to minimize his exposure to market risk by going short bt dollars of futures contracts. The
time t return on his hedged portfolio pt equals
pt  st  bt ft
where st and ft are the changes in the futures and spot prices respectively
and bt is the time t minimum variance hedge ratio.
The variance of the returns on the hedged portfolio, conditional
upon a set of L information variables Z available at time t  1, equals
s2 (pt 0 Zt1 )  s2 (st 0 Zt1 )  (bt 0 Zt1 ) 2s2 ( ft 0 Zt1 )  2(bt 0 Zt1 )s(st, ft 0 Zt1 )

Conditional OLS Minimum Variance Hedge Ratios

where s2 (. 0 Zt1 ) and s(.,. 0 Zt1 ) denote variance and covariance conditional upon Zt1.
The minimum variance hedge ratio is traditionally defined as the
value of (bt 0 Zt1 ) that sets the first derivative of s2 (pt 0 Zt1 ) with
respect to (bt 0 Zt1 ) equal to zero (for an OLS estimation, see, for example, Figlewski, 1984; or for a GARCH estimation see Kroner & Sultan,
1991). It is the optimal proportion of the spot asset that should be
hedged. It is equal to
(bt 0 Zt1 ) 

s(st, ft 0 Zt1 )
s2 ( ft 0 Zt1 )

A traditional approach to estimating a minimum variance hedge
ratio is to regress the return to the spot asset on the return to the futures
contract, implicitly assuming bt is constant.
st  a  bft  et

(1)

The slope coefﬁcient b is the static OLS minimum variance hedge ratio.
The hedger in this case makes no use of publicly available information
while forming expectations of future hedge ratios. The intercept a in
Equation (1) can be thought of as the mean of the change in the basis of
the hedged portfolio.
Alternatively, the hedger could model the time variation in the
hedge ratio by assuming a linear relationship between bt and a set of
(L1) mean zero instruments available at time t  1, zt1.2 bt then
equals
(bt 0 zt1 )  b0  b1zt1

(2)

where b0 measures the mean hedge ratio, b1 is a (L1)—vector of parameters, zt1  Zt1  E(Z) is a (L  1)—vector of normalized deviation
from Zt1. b1zt1 captures the time variation in the hedge ratio. It measures the departure from the mean hedge ratio b0. In this case, the riskminimizing hedge ratio is time dependent and changes as new information
arrives to the market. The time-varying hedge ratio will reduce to the static
OLS hedge ratio if no information is conveyed to the market.

2
This assumption is in line with conventional research on conditional asset pricing models (see,
among others, Harvey, 1989).

Substituting b in (1) by (bt 0 zt1 ) in (2) yields
st  a  b0 ft  b1 ftzt1  et

(3)

Equation (3) is a regression of the spot return on a constant, the
futures return, and the product of the futures return with the lagged
information variables. The conditional model (3) adds a vector of
(L  1) predictors ftzt1 to the regression traditionally used to measure
the static OLS hedge ratio. These regressors pick up the variation
through time in the hedge ratio that is related to changing economic
conditions. The resulting model is referred to as the conditional OLS
model with a constant basis.3
The static OLS model can also be extended to allow for time variation
in the change in the basis of the hedged portfolio. A linear relationship
similar to (2) is used to model the time variation in a (Christopherson
et al., 1998):
(at 0 zt1 )  a0  a1zt1

(4)

Substituting a in (3) by (at 0 zt1 ) in (4) leads to the following regression
st  a0  a1zt1  b0 ft  b1 ft zt1  et

(5)

This model is referred to as the conditional OLS model with a timevarying basis.
Note also that the static OLS model (1) is nested into the conditional OLS models (3) and (5). In particular, the conditional models can
be assessed against the static model by testing the restrictions b1  0 in
(3) and a1  b1  0 in (5). Under the hypothesis that the lagged information variables are insigniﬁcant, the conditional OLS models reduce to
the static OLS model.
The time t one-step ahead hedge ratios are estimated using the exante model (3) over the in-sample period. This produces estimates of the
coefﬁcients b0 and b1 in (3) and hence an estimate of the one-step ahead
conditional hedge ratio (bt 0 Zt1 ) in (2). The sample is then rolled over
to the next monthly observation and the model is re-estimated over the
new sample to produce a new estimate of the one-step ahead conditional
hedge ratio. Given the sample, this generates a time series of 84 rolling
over forecasts of the hedge ratio over the out-of-sample period June 1996
to May 2003.4 The assumption is, therefore, that hedgers reconsider
3

To correct for the fact that Zt1 only roughly approximates the true information set used by hedgers,
the standard errors in (3) are adjusted for ﬁrst order serial correlation and heteroscedasticity.

The same procedure is applied to the conditional OLS model with a time-varying basis in Equation (5).

their position on a monthly basis. They update the parameter estimates
at the end of each month as new information becomes available.
Alternative Speciﬁcations of the
Optimal Hedge Ratio
The ability of the conditional OLS hedge ratio to minimize portfolio risk
is compared to conventional static and dynamic approaches, such as the
naive hedge, the static OLS hedge, and a bivariate GARCH(1,1) model.
Each is deﬁned in turn below.
The nave approach simply sets the hedge ratio equal to one over the
period of the hedge. It, therefore, assumes a perfect correlation between
the futures and spot prices and no time variation in the hedge ratio.
The static OLS hedge ratio is deﬁned as b in (1). The hedger in that
case does not incorporate conditioning information.
The bivariate GARCH model captures the dynamics in the second
moments of the distribution of returns via a GARCH(1,1) error structure
and assumes that the correlation between the spot and futures returns r
is constant. It is as follows

where us,t and uf,t are residuals, h2s,t and h2f,t are conditional variances, hsf,t is
a conditional covariance. The parameters to estimate are ai, ai, bi, ci
for i  5s, f 6 and r. Equations (6a) and (6b) deﬁne the conditional mean
returns, Equations (6c)–(6f) deﬁne the conditional variance–covariance
matrix. The GARCH hedge ratio is measured as (hsf,t兾h2f,t ) in (6d) and (6f).
Two further tests are implemented. We test for the presence of time
variation in the conditional variances of returns (as  af  bs  bf  0) .
Like before for the conditional OLS models, the static OLS model
is nested in the GARCH model. Under the hypothesis that (as  af 

DATA
The data comprise end-of-month spot and futures prices on the S&P500
and the NYSE. The choice of a monthly frequency was dictated by the evidence that predictability is stronger for longer return horizons. On this
ground, it did not seem justiﬁed to test the conditional OLS model with
weekly or daily data as is typical in the hedging literature. To compile the
time series of futures prices, the closing prices on the nearest maturity
futures contract are collected, except in the maturity month when the
prices on the second nearest futures are used.5 Returns are computed as
100 times the difference in the logs of the prices at the end of the month.
The dataset spans the period June 1982 to May 2003. The sample is
split into two subsamples. The in-sample period covers the period June
1982 to May 1996, approximately two-thirds of the dataset, and is used
for estimation. The out-of-sample period, used for forecasting and hedging decisions, covers the remaining one-third.
Some of the information variables are specific to futures markets,
while others follow from the literature on return predictability and conditional asset pricing (see, for example, Fama & French, 1989; Ferson &
Harvey, 1993; Ferson & Schadt, 1996). These variables are a constant and
the ﬁrst lag in (1) the futures return, (2) the basis, (3) the dividend yield on
the US stock index, (4) the spread between BAA and AAA corporate bond
yield, and (5) the term structure of US interest rates.6 Note also that the
information variables are truly predictors, in the sense that they are constructed only with information that is already available at the time the optimal hedge ratio is calculated. For example, the information variables are
demeaned using data up to the month when the hedge ratio is estimated.
Table I reports the correlation matrix in the independent variables
of Equation (5) for both the S&P500 futures contracts (bottom left of
the matrix) and the NYSE futures contracts (top right of the matrix). The
correlations range from 0.31 to 0.37 for the S&P500 with an average
of 0.02 and from 0.33 to 0.42 for the NYSE with an average of 0.06.
With only a few exceptions, the correlations between the regressors are
small, suggesting that multicollinearity should not be a problem.
5

Rolling the hedge forward avoids thin trading and expiration effects. However, it introduces some
uncertainty about the spread between the futures price of the contract that is closed out and the
futures price of the new contract that is entered into. At these times, hedgers face roll-over risk as
well as basis risk. To avoid that the former clouds inference on the latter, it is standard to delete the
cross-over returns from the dataset. We nonetheless decided to include them on the ground that
with monthly data and four contracts a year, deleting the roll-over returns would have substantially
shortened our time series.
6
Fama and French (1989) and Chen (1991) show that dividend yield, default spread, and the term
structure predict the business cycle one period ahead. As such, they could command higher hedge
ratios when a recession is anticipated and lower hedge ratios when an economic recovery is expected.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Statistical Signiﬁcance of Conditioning
Information: The Conditional OLS Models
Valid conclusions regarding the ability of the conditional OLS hedge to
reduce portfolio volatility can only be drawn within a well-specified
conditional model. To ensure that this condition is met, model (3) is
estimated via OLS over the in-sample period and the hypothesis of a constant hedge ratio is tested using a 2 test with (L  1) degrees of freedom.
Table II, Panel A reports the coefficient estimates of the static OLS
model (1). Table II, Panel B presents similar information for the conditional OLS model with a constant basis. Table II, Panel C reports 2 and
probability values for the test of the marginal explanatory power of the
conditioning information variables in (3). Ultimately, Table II, Panel C,
tests the conditional OLS model with a constant basis against the static
OLS model and tells us whether the static OLS model is misspeciﬁed.
Table II, Panel C, makes it clear that the information variables
are jointly significant at 1% over the in-sample period. Similar tests

The conditional OLS model with a constant basis is as follows:
st  a  b0 ft  b1,F ft Ft1  b1,B ft Bt1  b1,DY ft DYt1  b1,DS ft DSt1  b1,TS ftTSt1  et

st and ft are the spot and futures returns, respectively. The information variables, measured at time t  1,
include: Ft1 (futures return), Bt1 (basis), DYt1 (dividend yield), DSt1 (default spread), and TSt1 (term structure). et are residuals, a, b0, and b1,i for i  {F, B, DY, DS, TS} are the estimated parameters.

Conditional OLS Minimum Variance Hedge Ratios

implemented over the out-of-sample period also suggest that the information variables have time and again a role to play in capturing the variation in the hedge ratio. A closer look at the t-ratios in Panel B indicates
that the basis is particularly crucial at predicting the hedge ratio one
period ahead. Clearly, according to Table II, it is important to allow the
risk minimizing hedge ratio to be time dependent instead of restricting it
to be constant. This suggests that the static OLS model is misspeciﬁed.
Consequently, restricting the hedge ratio to be constant, instead of conditioning it on past information, might lead to poor hedging decisions.
This point notwithstanding, the explanatory power of the conditional
model is only marginally higher (on average, the adjusted R-squared of
the conditional regressions is only 0.3% higher than the adjusted
R-squared of the static models). The adjusted R-squareds of the regressions range from 96.5 to 97.4%. This indicates that, irrespectively of the
hedge ratio considered, selling stock index futures eliminates roughly
97% of the volatility of the long position in the equity market and thus
that the basis risk of the hedged portfolio is only marginal.
In Table III, the conditional OLS model with a constant basis is
extended to allow for time variation in the change in the basis. Panel A,
reports the estimated parameters for the change in the basis and tests the
joint signiﬁcance of the lagged information variables. Panel B, presents
similar information for the hedge ratio. Panel C tests the joint signiﬁcance of both a1 and b1 in Equation (5). Namely, Panel C tests the conditional OLS model with a time-varying basis against the static OLS
model.
Like Table II previously, Table III documents substantial in-sample
predictability of the hedge ratios (Panel B). It also reveals that the
change in the basis is correlated with public information (Panel A).7
The hypothesis of a constant basis (a1  0 in Panel A) and the hypothesis of a constant hedge ratio (b1  0 in Panel B) are both rejected. The
adjusted R-squareds of the conditional OLS model with a time-varying
basis are only slightly higher than the ones reported for the static OLS
model in Table II. Conditioning the change in the basis and the hedge
ratio on past information only increases the explanatory power of the
model by an average of 1.21%.
Table III, Panel C tests the conditional OLS model with a timevarying basis relative to the static OLS model. Namely, Panel C tests the
validity of the restriction that both a1 and b1 are insigniﬁcant over the
in-sample period. The 2 tests consistently reject the static OLS model
in favor of the conditional specification. This reinforces the view put
7

This result is consistent with the evidence presented in Bailey and Chan (1993), Baum and
Barkoulas (1996), and Miffre (2004) on the predictability of the basis.

ratio over the entire out-of-sample period.
Alternative Optimal Hedge Ratio:
The GARCH Model
The paper examines the ability of different hedge ratios to minimize portfolio risk. In particular, special attention is given to estimating the minimum variance hedge ratio via a bivariate GARCH(1,1) model. The
results are reported in Table IV. Panel A reports the estimated coefficients over the in-sample period. Panel B tests the GARCH model

against the static OLS model by imposing the restrictions as  af 
bs  bf  0 on the conditional model (6a)–(6f).
The t-ratios and x2 tests indicate that the parameters as, af, bs, and bf,
are jointly signiﬁcant for the S&P500, suggesting that the GARCH error
structure captures the dynamics in the second moments of the joint distribution of returns. Ultimately, this implies that the conditional variances (h2s,t and h2f,t ) and covariances (hsf,t ) are changing over time. This
conﬁrms that the risk-minimizing hedge ratios are indeed time-varying.
The in-sample results for the NYSE are somehow surprising given the
results reported in the existing literature (Park & Switzer, 1995; Brooks,
Henry, & Persand, 2002). The lagged coefﬁcients in Equations (6e) and
(6f) are insigniﬁcant, suggesting that the GARCH(1,1) speciﬁcation fails
to capture the time variation, if any, in the NYSE hedge ratio. This may be
due to the use of monthly data (as opposed to weekly or daily data in previous studies) and thus could be the result of our short sample size. Note,
however, that this is not necessarily the case since in over a third of the outof-sample period, the hypothesis that as  af  bs  bf  0 is rejected.
This suggests that for a third of the sample, the GARCH error structure
captures the time variation in the NYSE hedge ratio.

Note. The variance of the hedged portfolio is measured as s2 (st  ht ft ) , where st, ht, and ft are the time t spot return,
hedge ratio, and futures return, respectively. HE1 (HE2) measures hedging effectiveness with regards to the conditional
OLS hedge with a constant basis (with a time-varying basis). Hedging effectiveness is measured as the percentage
increase (if positive, decrease if negative) in risk of each hedge ratio relative to the conditional OLS hedge ratios (e.g.,
0.242 means that the naive hedge ratio increases basis risk by 24.2% more than the conditional OLS hedge with a constant
basis).

the static OLS hedge, and the GARCH hedge, to minimize risk. For each
of the respective hedge ratios, the variance of the hedged portfolio is
computed each month as s2 (st  bt ft ) . The lower the basis risk is, the
better is hedging effectiveness.
The in-sample results are summarized in Table V, Panel A. Table V
reports the basis risk of the hedged portfolio under different estimates of
the hedge ratio. It also reports measures of hedging effectiveness,
estimated as the percentage increase (if positive, decrease if negative) in
risk of each hedge ratio relative to the conditional OLS models. For
example, 0.242 (0.079) in Table V, Panel A, indicates that the naive
hedge ratio increases basis risk by 24.2% (7.9%) more than the conditional OLS model with a constant (time-varying) basis.
The in-sample results clearly indicate that a hedger who uses the
conditional OLS hedge can substantially reduce the volatility of his
hedged portfolio. For example, the basis risk of the conditional OLS
hedge with a constant basis is 0.09352 for the S&P500. This compares

Conditional OLS Minimum Variance Hedge Ratios

favorably with the variance of the naive, static OLS, and GARCH hedges
(0.11613, 0.11362, and 0.11721, respectively). Relative to the naive
hedge, the conditional OLS hedge with a constant basis eliminates
24.2% more of the volatility of the S&P500 index. Compared to the static OLS hedge, it enhances hedging effectiveness by 21.5%. It reduces
the basis risk of the hedged portfolio by a further 25.3% relative to
GARCH. The conditional OLS model with a constant basis reduces
basis risk better than the alternative hedging strategies for the NYSE too.
Note also that allowing for time dependency in both the change in the
basis and the hedge ratio does not improve in-sample hedging effectiveness relative to the conditional OLS model with a constant basis. This
conclusion prevails for both the S&P500 futures and the NYSE futures.
The GARCH model fares particularly poorly for the S&P500. This
may be due to the small sample size that results from the use of monthly
data. Note also that the static OLS hedge reduces portfolio volatility by
more than the naive hedge.
Hedging Effectiveness: Out-of-Sample Results
How much variance reduction can be achieved if one uses historical
hedge ratios to determine appropriate hedging strategies for future time
periods? Hedgers who use the roll-over OLS, GARCH, and conditional
OLS hedges are assumed to re-estimate the risk-minimizing hedge ratio
at the end of each month using the most recently available information
set. This hedge ratio is then used as a basis for risk management over the
following month.
The out-of-sample results are reported in Table V, Panel B. For both
the S&P500 and the NYSE indices, conditioning the hedge ratio on past
information reduces out-of-sample portfolio volatility more substantially
than managing risk via the naive, roll-over OLS, and GARCH approaches. For the S&P500, the conditional OLS hedge with a time-varying
basis reduces basis risk by 12.9% more than the naive hedge. It also fares
better than the roll-over OLS and the GARCH hedges, with percentage
reduction in risk that are, respectively, 9.7 and 15.6% higher. For the
NYSE index, exposure to basis risk is minimized when the hedge ratio is
measured via the conditional OLS model with a constant basis. Note
also that the out-of-sample results for both the S&P500 and the NYSE
index indicate a poor hedging performance of the GARCH hedge relative
to the roll-over OLS and naive hedges. Again this might be due to our
small sample.

A last test is implemented to ensure that the conditional OLS hedge
ratio8 differs from its naive, roll-over OLS, and GARCH counterparts.
Figures 1 and 2 plot the estimated hedge ratios for each stock index over
the whole sample. A casual look at the ﬁgures indicates that the conditional
OLS hedge ratio is not a replica of the hedge ratios already present in the
literature on risk management. This hypothesis is tested by calculating for
each of the two indices the correlation between the conditional OLS hedge
ratio and its counterparts. These correlations range from 0.23 to 0.03
for the S&P500 and from 0.05 to 0.42 for the NYSE. It seems, therefore,
that the conditional OLS model does not capture the same variation in the
hedge ratio as the roll-over OLS and GARCH models. As the competing
hedge ratios do differ, the inferences drawn from one model will be at odds
with the one advocated by a competing approach.

CONCLUSIONS
The article presents a new methodology to estimate minimum variance
hedge ratios. This methodology relies on previous work on conditional asset
pricing and on conditional portfolio performance evaluation (Ferson &
Warther, 1996; Ferson & Schadt, 1996; Christopherson et al., 1998). It
modiﬁes the static OLS model to account for conditioning information.
The advantages of this approach are that (1) it recognizes the less than perfect correlation between spot and futures prices, (2) it captures the stochastic movements in hedge ratios arising from the predictability of returns, and
(3) it is easy to estimate and produces virtually instant estimates of the
hedge ratio. These characteristics make the conditional OLS hedge ratio
potentially superior to the traditional naive, static OLS, and GARCH
hedges as a theoretical construct for risk management.
These considerations motivated the empirical analysis of the article. The hypothesis tested here is that the basis risk of the hedged portfolio is minimized when one allows via a set of lagged information variables for some stochastic movements in the hedge ratio. The ability of
the conditional OLS hedge ratio to minimize portfolio risk is compared
to conventional static and dynamic approaches, such as the naive
hedge, the roll-over OLS hedge, and the bivariate GARCH model.
Special attention is given to measuring hedging effectiveness in-sample
and out-of-sample.

The remainder of the paper focuses on the conditional OLS hedge ratios that perform the best outof-sample; namely, the one with a conditional basis for the S&P500 and the one with a constant
basis for the NYSE.

Conditional OLS Minimum Variance Hedge Ratios

The conclusions are as follows. First, the time variation in the optimal hedge ratio is captured by a set of information variables available at
time t  1. Second, the conditional OLS hedge ratio reduces in-sample
and out-of-sample portfolio volatility better than the naive, static OLS,
and GARCH approaches. It follows that hedgers with relatively long-term
horizons may welcome this approach as a new tool for risk management.
Thus far, we have not taken into consideration the impact that transaction costs may have on the desirability of our dynamic hedge. Given that
the risk reductions generated through our hedge ratios are substantial, it
may well be the case that the beneﬁts of the conditional OLS hedge in
terms of risk reduction more than outweigh the cost of dynamic hedging.
However, we have not tested this hypothesis formally and leave it, therefore, as a possible avenue for future research in risk management.
