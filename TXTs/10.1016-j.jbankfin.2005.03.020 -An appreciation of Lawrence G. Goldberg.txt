Editorial

An appreciation of Lawrence G. Goldberg

With the passing of Lawrence (Larry) G. Goldberg the Journal of Banking and
Finance has lost one of its long standing Associate Editors and proliﬁc contributors.
From its very beginning Larry was a strong supporter of the journal publishing 13
papers over a period spanning much of the journalÕs 30 year existence.
Larry received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1972. From this beginning he followed a long and varied career encompassing regulatory, academic and
business activities. In 1971 Larry joined the Federal Reserve Board of Governors
as an economist moving to the Federal Trade Commission in 1974. In 1977 Larry
became an Associate Professor of Finance at NYUÕs Business School leaving in
1981 to join the University of Miami where he held the position of Professor of
Finance and at various times Chair of the Finance Department. From 1994 onwards
Larry was also a Director of Kislak National Bank.
LarryÕs research record shows a scholar persistently asking new and interesting
questions. Over a 30 year period Larry published more than 60 papers in journals
such as the Journal of Finance, Journal of Banking and Finance, Journal of Money,
Credit, and Banking, Review of Economics and Statistics, Journal of Business, Journal
of Financial Economics, and the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis as well
as many others. His research interests and publications spanned all facets of
banking and ﬁnancial intermediation as well as health care economics. Indeed, in
the last year or so of his life Larry published papers in the Journal of Business, the
Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis as well as the Journal of Banking
and Finance.
As news of his illness spread among colleagues and friends a number got together
to establish a special prize in his name at NYU ‘‘The Lawrence G. Goldberg Prize
for the best Ph.D. in Financial Intermediation.’’ This strong and overwhelming reaction shows the high professional regard and personal aﬀection with which he was
held. Indeed, a few days before his passing Viral Acharya of London Business
School was announced as the ﬁrst winner of a prize that will be awarded biennially
in perpetuity.
