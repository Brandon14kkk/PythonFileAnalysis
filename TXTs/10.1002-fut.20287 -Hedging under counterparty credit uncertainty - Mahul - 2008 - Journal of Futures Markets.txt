HEDGING UNDER
COUNTERPARTY CREDIT
UNCERTAINTY
OLIVIER MAHUL*
J. DAVID CUMMINS

This study investigates optimal production and hedging decisions for firms facing
price risk that can be hedged with vulnerable contracts, i.e., exposed to nonhedgeable endogenous counterparty credit risk. When vulnerable forward contracts are
the only hedging instruments available, the firm’s optimal level of production is
lower than without credit risk. Under plausible conditions on the stochastic
dependence between the commodity price and the counterparty’s assets, the firm
does not sell its entire production on the vulnerable forward market. When
options on forward contracts are also available, the optimal hedging strategy
requires a long put position. This provides a new rationale for the hedging role of
options in the over-the-counter markets exposed to counterparty credit risk.

Hedging under Counterparty Credit Uncertainty

249

Crouhy, and Schlesinger (1993) and Mahul (2002) examine how the presence
of basis risk alters the optimal hedging strategy on financial markets. Moschini
and Lapan (1995) analyze the optimal hedging decisions for firms facing price,
basis, and production risk, assuming that hedging instruments are only available for price risk. Wong (2003a) investigates the optimal hedging decision of
a competitive exporting firm that faces hedgeable exchange rate risk and nonhedgeable price risk.
These models assume that financial contracts are not exposed to counterparty’s credit risk: the counterparty is always assumed to make the promised
payment in full. However, many financial assets are sold by market participants
who have limited assets and therefore default is often a possibility that must be
taken seriously, particularly if it follows a very sudden and strong movement in
prices (Johnson & Stulz, 1987). These financial contracts, exposed to counterparty credit risk, are labeled “vulnerable contracts.” This source of risk is particularly relevant on the over-the-counter markets, where no clearance board
guarantees the full payment should the counterparty become insolvent. Several
methods for pricing derivatives involving credit risk have been provided (see, e.g.,
Jarrow & Turnbull, 1995; Johnson & Stulz, 1987), but, to the best of our knowledge, the question concerning their proper application as hedging instruments
remains largely unexplored. The only exceptions are in the insurance economics
literature, where Doherty and Schlesinger (1990) and Mahul and Wright (2004)
examine the demand for non-performing insurance. They show that, in the
presence of an exogenous risk of default, i.e., the default risk is independent of
the insurance decisions, partial insurance coverage is always purchased at an
actuarial fair price.
This study examines the problem of a firm choosing an optimal hedge
against price risk in financial markets, where financial contracts are subject to
unhedgeable/uninsurable counterparty credit risk. This credit risk is endogenous, that is, the firm’s hedging decisions will affect the counterparty’s default
risk. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it investigates the firm’s hedging and production decisions when vulnerable forward contracts are available.
It shows that the presence of credit risk induces the hedging firm to reduce
its production and that, under plausible assumptions, its vulnerable forward
position requires partial coverage. Second, it investigates the use of options in
the presence of credit risk, called vulnerable options. This is related to the
scant literature on the hedging role of options. This literature points out that
options, in additions to forward/futures contracts, are important hedging
instruments when profits are not linear in the hedgeable source of risk. This
nonlinearity may stem from the production flexibility of the competitive firm
(Moschini & Lapan, 1992; Wong, 2003b) or the multiplicative interaction
between the hedgeable and non-hedgeable risks (Brown & Toft, 2001;

Moschini & Lapan, 1995; Sakong et al., 1993; Wong, 2003a). This study
offers a new rationale for the hedging role of options traded on the overthe-counter markets. It shows that the presence of credit risk induces the hedging firm to purchase (vulnerable) options, although these contracts are sold at
a fair price and the profit function is linear in the hedgeable price risk. This
contrasts with the previous studies that focus on the nonlinearity of the profit
function as the key point for the use of options.
The next section presents the model and its assumptions in the expected
utility framework. Optimal production and hedging decisions with vulnerable
forward contracts are investigated in the followingsection. The demand for vulnerable options in the presence of vulnerable forwards is discussed in the section
Hedging decisions with vulnerable option contracts. The final section gives the
conclusion.
THE MODEL
A two-date model is considered in which a competitive firm produces a single
output. Before the resolution of uncertainty, the firm has to commit to an output level, q. The (non-random) production process can be described in a
reduced form by a cost function, c(q), with c(0)  0, c′(q)  0, and c′′(q)  0.
The firm expects to sell the output quantity q on the forward market at a price
~
p.1,2 A forward contract is defined as a promise to deliver one unit of the commodity at the end of the period for the specified forward price.
The vulnerable forward contract is described as follows. The contract

I(p)  K, and thus he pays its commitment in full. If the contract writer cannot make the promised payment, I(p)  K, then he is considered as insolvent
and the hedging firm holding the contract receives only K.

hedging firm is assumed to always fulfill its commitments, e.g., because of high
reputational costs.3
In this model, the hedging firm faces two sources of uncertainty: the
commodity price risk that can be hedged on the over-the-counter markets and
the counterparty credit risk that is assumed to be unhedgeable/uninsurable. In this
context of incomplete markets, the terminology “full coverage” means that the
hedging firm is fully covered against the variations in the random settlement price
when the contract is fully performing, i.e., when the counterparty does not default.
The hedging firm is assumed to take its decisions to maximize the expected value of an increasing and concave transformation u(.) of its profit p. The
firm can be an expected utility maximizer, where u(.) is the von NeumannMorgenstern utility function, and it exhibits risk aversion. This can also be a
value-maximizing firm, where the expected profit net of deadweight costs is
u(p)  p  d(p) , with d(.) being the exogenous deadweight cost function,
d(p)  0, and d–(p)  0. This function captures most of the popular motivations for why a firm hedges: market imperfections (Greenwald & Stiglitz,
1993), direct and indirect costs of financial distress (Smith & Stulz, 1985),
information asymmetries that raise the cost of external funds relative to internal funds (Froot, Scharfstein, & Stein, 1993; Smith & Stulz, 1985).
PRODUCTION AND HEDGING DECISIONS WITH
VULNERABLE FORWARD CONTRACTS
The firm can hedge against commodity price volatility on the over-the-counter
forward markets. These contracts are subject to counterparty credit risk
because there is no mechanism, such as a clearance board, that gives the hedging firm a guarantee that the contract will be fully honored. With over-thecounter forward markets available, the hedging firm’s profit is expressed as

where p0 is the forward price and n the number of contracts sold (if n  0) or

As noted by a referee, a symmetric approach would be to consider that the hedging firm can also default.
Risk-taking decisions with limited liability have been investigated by Gollier, Koehl, and Rochet (1997).
Including limited liability in the present model makes the problem of credit risk much more difficult to
address, because the primary objective of this study is to investigate optimal vulnerable hedging strategies. It
is thus left to further research.

The default risk is thus characterized by the multiplicative background risk

Hedging under Counterparty Credit Uncertainty

253

If the forward contracts are not subject to credit risk, i.e., the counterparty
always fulfills its commitments, the second RHS term in Equation (6) vanishes.
Therefore, any firm will select the output level at which the forward price equals
the marginal production costs, despite its probability belief and attitude toward
risk. This is the contribution of forward markets and the essence of the separation theorem, as stated by Holthausen (1979) and Feder, Just, and Schmitz
(1980). When the forward contracts are exposed to counterparty’s credit risk, the
RHS integral in Equation (6) is negative and, as a consequence, the optimal output level q* satisfies c(q*) 	 p0. This leads to the following proposition.
Proposition 1: The firm’s optimal production level under vulnerable forward
markets is smaller than that under non-vulnerable forward markets.
The presence of credit risk in over-the-counter forward markets induces
the hedging firm to reduce its level of production. In other words, the development of organized forward markets with an effective clearance board (i.e., which
eliminates credit risk) gives the firms the incentives to increase their production,
assuming the clearance board is free of cost. When the forward contracts are
exposed to credit risk, the optimal output level depends on the distribution of
random variables and the firm’s attitude toward risk, as shown by the second
RHS term in Equation (6). A direct consequence is that the separation theorem
does not hold.

The optimal hedge can be decomposed into three terms: a “pure hedge”
equal to the output level q, a “speculative” component caused by the difference between the expected settlement price and the current price, and a
“default” component due to the correlation between the random settlement
price and the probability of default conditional on the realization of the settlement price. The speculative component induces the hedging firm to decrease
(increase) its hedge, as the vulnerable forward price is lower (higher) than
the expected settlement price. The default component, characterized by the
covariance term in Equation (8), leads the hedging firm to increase (decrease)
its hedge as this covariance term is positive or negative, i.e., as default risk
tends to be higher in the states of nature where the settlement price is lower.
A sufficient condition is that the probability of default increases (decreases) as
the settlement price increases. Differentiating it with respect to the settlement
price gives

the covariance term is thus indeterminate. The following proposition summarizes this discussion.
Proposition 2: Suppose that the vulnerable forward price is equal to or lower
than the expected settlement price. If an increase in the settlement price makes the
counterparty’s assets less risky by the first-degree stochastic dominance or if the two
random variables are stochastically independent, then the firm’s optimal vulnerable
forward position requires partial coverage, n* 	 q.
The optimality of full coverage with unbiased (performing) forward
contracts is a well-known result (see, e.g., Holthausen, 1979). However, full
coverage in all states of nature is not possible when forward contracts are
subject to credit risk. Partial coverage allows the hedging firm to shift wealth
from states of nature where the counterparty has sufficient capital to make the
promised payment to states where he cannot make the payment in full, i.e., it
defaults.
The stochastic dependence between the contract writer’s assets and the
settlement price as described in Proposition 2 may be justified by the existence
of a systemic component in these two risky assets caused, for example, by an
imperfect diversification within the counterparty’s portfolio. For example, a
global financial market crash is likely to generate a drop in the settlement price
as well as in the value of the counterparty’s portfolio, thus increasing the threat
of counterparty’ insolvency.

HEDGING DECISIONS WITH VULNERABLE
OPTION CONTRACTS
The optimal hedging strategy of the firm is now examined when options contracts are available hedging instruments in addition to forward contracts.
Contrary to previous studies (see, e.g., Moschini & Lapan, 1995), the model is
not restricted to the case where a single strike price for the option is available.
Hence, the hedging firm can select its strike price over a continuum of strike
prices [0, pmax]. The firm’s optimal hedging decision is derived in two steps.

First, an optimal (vulnerable) hedging instrument is designed in the presence of
(vulnerable) forward contracts. Second, this first-best solution is replicated with
options on forward contracts.
Designing an Optimal Hedging Instrument
Subject to Credit Risk
The hedging firm sells n vulnerable forward contracts with a forward price p0,
as discussed in the previous section. In addition, the firm can purchase a
vulnerable hedging instrument described by the couple [I(.),P], where P is
the premium and I(p) is the payoff made by the performing counterparty
when the realized settlement price is p. The payoff function is assumed to be
non-negative:
I(p)  0

(10)

for all p

When the counterparty is non-performing (insolvent), the hedging firm
receives only K. The vulnerable hedging contract is assumed to be fairly priced,
i.e., its expected net payoff is zero given the expectation of the firm:
~
p), K].4
P  E min[I( ~
p)  n(p0  ~

(11)

To find the form of an optimal vulnerable hedging instrument, the premium p and the function I(.) that maximizes the firm’s expected utility of
profit subject to the above constraints have to be found. The problem is stated
as follows:
pmax Kmax

subject to constraints (10) and (11).
The problem is solved in two steps. First, an optimal vulnerable hedging
instrument is designed for a fixed premium P. Second, the objective function is
optimized with respect to P. The following lemma characterizes the solution to
the maximization problem (12).

Our intention here is not to impose an ad hoc option pricing theory but to focus on the hedging role of
(vulnerable) options.

Lemma 2: Suppose a positive probability of solvency. The optimal hedging
instrument I*(p) under solvency, solution to the maximization program (12) subject to conditions (10) and (11), provides full marginal coverage under a strike
price p̂  [0, pmax]: I*(p)  (q  n)max(p̂  p,0), where n is the firm’s forward
position.
The optimal strike price p̂ is defined in the following lemma.
Lemma 3: Suppose that the price of the vulnerable hedging contract is unbiased and the firm’s forward position is n. The optimal strike price satisfies
p̂ 	 pmax if the covariance term

is positive. It satisfies p̂  pmax otherwise.
The proofs of Lemmas 2 and 3 are relegated to the Appendix. When
the hedging contract is fairly priced, the optimal strike price p̂ level is lower
than or equal to the maximum price pmax depending on whether the “default
component” expressed by the covariance term in Equation (13) is positive or
non-positive.
Hedging Decisions
The first-best hedging instrument characterized by Lemmas 2 and 3 is
used to derive the optimal hedging strategy with options on forward contracts.
The sign of covariance term in Equation (13) plays a key role in the optimal
trigger price. It is worth noting that

From the concavity of u and the optimal form of the hedging instrument
as expressed in Lemma 2, the above expression is non-positive if n  q.
Sufficient conditions for partial coverage with vulnerable forwards, n/q 	 1,
to be optimal have been identified in Proposition 2. The covariance term (13)
is thus positive or negative depending on whether the probability of counterparty default is a decreasing (increasing) function of the settlement price.
Differentiating this probability of default with respect to the settlement
price yields

The first RHS term in Equation (15) is negative from the optimal design
of the hedging contract for p 	 p̂ and equals zero for all p  p̂. The second
RHS term is negative (positive) if an increase in the settlement price p
~
makes the conditional distribution of K less risky (riskier) by FSD. It is equal
to zero if the assets of the counterparty and the settlement price are
stochastically independent. Consequently, if the contract writer’s assets
become less risky according to the FSD criterion as the settlement price
increases or if the two random variables are independent, then the covariance term is positive. It may be negative if the assets become riskier according to the FSD criterion as the settlement price increases. Combining
Proposition 2, Lemma 2 and Lemma 3 with the above discussion leads to the
main result of this study.
Proposition 3: Suppose that the vulnerable options on forward contracts
are available and fairly priced, and the hedging firm’s optimal vulnerable
forward position is n. If an increase in the settlement price makes the counterparty’s assets less risky by first-degree stochastic dominance or if the two
random variables are independent, then the firm’s optimal hedging strategy
requires a long vulnerable put position with a hedge ratio to output equal
to 1  nq  0.
When the default risk is more likely to occur in the states of nature with
low settlement price, then the optimal hedging strategy is to buy put options
in a quantity equal to the production level net of the forward position, q  n.
The hedging firm can replicate the first-best vulnerable hedging contract
with vulnerable options as long as it can choose the strike price. Note that
full coverage in all states of nature is not possible when options are subject
to credit risk. Selecting a strike price lower than the most favorable realization of the commodity price allows the firm to shift wealth from states of
nature where the counterparty is fully performing to states where the counterparty defaults through a decrease in the premium. This thus increases
wealth in states where the firm’s marginal utility is the highest. Therefore,
the presence of credit risk induces the firm to purchase put options on forward contracts, with the number of put options equal to the firm’s output
level net of its forward position. The presence of credit risk thus offers a new
rationale for the use of (vulnerable) options, which complements previous

259

analyses relying on the nonlinearity of the profit function (with respect to
the settlement price).
It is worth noting that, when options on forward contracts are the only
available hedging instrument, i.e., n  0, the firm’s optimal hedging strategy
requires a long vulnerable put position with a hedge ratio to output equal
to unity.
CONCLUSION
The development of innovative financial products on over-the-counter markets makes the risk of counterparty more acute. This study has examined the
optimal production and hedging decisions of a firm under a hedgeable price
risk and a non-hedgeable credit risk. When (vulnerable) forward contracts
are the only available hedging instruments, the separation theorem fails and
that the firm does not sell its entire production in the forward market. When
(vulnerable) options are also available, the optimal hedging strategy requires
a long (vulnerable) put position. The hedge ratio to output is equal to 1
when the (vulnerable) options on forwards are the only hedging instruments
available.
A natural extension of this model will be to introduce a financial tool to
deal with credit risk and to analyze hedging decisions with two separate hedging contracts. Another way of research will be to examine how the firm could
efficiently hedge price risk with futures contracts subject to basis risk and
forward contracts exposed to credit risk. This would lead to analyze the tradeoff
between basis risk and credit risk and, more specifically, the tradeoff between
the cost of basis risk and the cost of credit risk due to imperfect coverage
against price risk. This model could also be tested empirically to investigate
how hedging decisions are related to the degree of credit risk in the hedging
instruments.
