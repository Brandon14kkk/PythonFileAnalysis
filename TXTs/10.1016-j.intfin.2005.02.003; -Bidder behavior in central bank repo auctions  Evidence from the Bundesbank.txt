Abstract
For many central banks, repo auctions are the most important monetary policy instrument. This
paper employs a unique data set of individual bids submitted in the repo auctions of the Bundesbank
to analyze the determinants of banks’ bidding behavior and the empirical performance of repo auctions. We conduct a panel analysis to estimate how banks bidding is affected by various auction as
well as bidder-specific factors including interest rate expectations, interest rate uncertainty, maturing
allotment, reserve fulfillment and a bank’s size.

of the operational target but also for the setup of central bank open market operations.
Institutional details of the operational framework may influence the working of money
markets, banks’ demand for reserves, and the volatility of short-term interest rates. For
many central banks, including the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank
(ECB), repo auctions are the predominant instrument for the money market management
and the control of the monetary base. In fact, virtually all money market operations of the
Bundesbank and the ECB are carried out using repo auctions.
This paper employs a unique data set of individual bids submitted in the repo auctions
of the Bundesbank to shed more light on the determinants of banks’ bidding behavior and
the empirical performance of repo auctions. We characterize the bidding behavior of a bank
by its participation decision and the individual bid amount. These endogenous bidding
variables will be explained by various auction-specific as well as bidder-specific factors
including interest rate expectations, interest rate uncertainty, maturing allotment, reserve
fulfillment and the bank’s size.
Our paper is closely related to Bindseil et al. (2004) and Scalia and Ordine (2003) who
analyze banks’ bidding behavior in the repo auctions of the ECB. Both studies find that
bidder behavior in repo auctions differs from those documented for Treasury bill auctions in
two important respects. First, in contrast to the empirical literature on Treasury bill auctions,
they found no evidence for the winner’s curse effect in repo auctions.1 Second, bidders in
the ECB’s repo auctions are particularly concerned about interest rate expectations. For
example, when banks expect interest rates to decrease, they underbid, i.e. they refrain from
bidding.
In the following, we will estimate panel regressions for the probability of bidding and a
bank’s individual bid amount. We explicitly account for the censored distribution of the bid
amount by applying a tobit model that uses both, the probability of a bank’s participation
and the distribution of the bid amount given that it is positive.2 In the same vein, in the logit
analysis of banks’ participation decision, we did not remove the bidders never participating
in an auction to avoid distorting effects on the estimated probabilities.
Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, in line with the evidence provided
by Bindseil et al. (2004) and Scalia and Ordine (2003) we found no convincing evidence
for a winner’s curse effect in the Bundesbank repo auctions. Second, in contrast to the
ECB’s experience the estimated impact of interest rate expectations on banks’ bidding in
the Bundesbank’s repo auctions is only small. In particular, underbidding or even bidder
strikes were not an issue in the Bundesbank auctions.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews institutional
details of repo auctions and the evidence on the impact of interest rate expectations and rate
uncertainty on the behavior of bidders. In Section 3, we introduce the data and variables
used in the following panel regressions Section 4 presents the empirical analysis of banks’

et al. (2002).

property of the data is often neglected in the empirical literature on auctions, see, e.g. Scalia and Ordine (2003),
Nyborg et al. (2002) and Bjonnes (2001) or Breitung and Nautz (2001). Notable exceptions are Ayuso and Repullo
(2001) and Linzert et al. (2004).

bidding in the Bundesbank’s auctions. First, we estimate a logit model to analyze banks’
participation decision. In a second step, we employ a panel tobit model to investigate the
determinants of a bank’s bid amount. Section 5 gives a summary of the main results and
offers some policy conclusions.

2. Interest rate expectations and uncertainty in central bank auctions
Following the monetary policy practice of the Bundesbank, weekly repo auctions are the
ECB’s dominant monetary policy instrument. The repo rates applied in the ECB’s main refinancing operations (MROs) govern the money market rates and the repo volume determines
the liquidity of the European banking sector. Since June 2000, MROs are conducted as variable rate tenders, where banks bid both the amount of money they wish to obtain and the
interest rate at which the repo transaction is settled. Yet, in order to signal the intended interest rate level, the ECB introduced a minimum bid rate, i.e. it disregards bids below a certain
interest rate level. In fact, this minimum bid rate is now viewed as the ECB’s key interest rate.
Apart from the minimum bid rate, however, all relevant institutional details in the ECB’s
and the Bundesbank’s operational framework are the same. The rules and the maturity of the
Bundesbank’s and the ECB’s repo auctions are identical, as well as their role and importance
in the monetary policy setup. Finally, both central banks have a monthly reserve period with
reserve averaging such that rate expectations should have an influence on banks’ bidding.
Interestingly, Bindseil et al. (2004) found that interest rate expectations are particularly
relevant for banks’ bidding behavior in the MRO auctions. In particular, the ECB’s minimum
bid rate implies a clear incentive for banks to postpone refinancing whenever they expect a
rate cut.3
For Treasury bill auctions, it is well documented that bidders are exposed to the winner’s
curse effect, see e.g. Gordy (1999), Bjonnes (2001) and Nyborg et al. (2002). To mitigate
the winner’s curse, rational bidders should bid more cautiously when rate uncertainty increases by bidding at lower rates, reducing the quantity demanded and increasing the bid
rate dispersion. Recently, Linzert et al. (2004) confirmed the winner’s curse effect in the
ECB’s longer term refinancing operations (LTROs) indicating that banks’ demand for longer
term refinancing crucially depends on common market conditions. Interestingly, however,
Bindseil et al. (2004) found no evidence in favor of the winner’s curse effect in the ECB’s
MROs. This indicates that the demand for reserves in MROs is closely related to the banks’
private liquidity needs and thus less influenced by common market conditions. The role of
interest rate expectations and rate uncertainty for bidder behavior in central bank auctions is
still under debate: For example, Scalia and Ordine (2003) found that higher rate uncertainty
may even induce bidders to submit larger bids at higher rates in ECB’s MROs suggesting
that banks are more concerned about the risk of losing in an auction, not winning.
3 Notice, however, that the ECB substantially revised its operational framework of monetary policy to stop
banks’ from underbidding, see ECB (2003). The reserve periods are now determined by the meetings of the
Governing councils and the maturity of the main refinancing operations will be reduced to 1 week. As a result, rate
expectations should not matter any more for banks bidding as the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged
within the maintenance period.

In order to shed more light on the determinants of bidder behavior in central bank
auctions, this paper employs a unique data set of individual bids submitted in the repo
auctions of the Bundesbank analyzing the importance of various auction- as well as bidderspecific variables on bidder behavior. To that aim, the empirical study is organized as
follows. First, we will investigate the determinants of the participation decision of a single
bank. And second, having estimated the participation probability we investigate the factors
determining the individual bidding volume.

3. Data and theoretical predictions
3.1. The bidding data
The following empirical analysis is based on a data set of weekly repo auctions performed
by the Bundesbank. We collected individual bidding data (which was not available in computer readable form) of 275 banks that had submitted their bids at the Land Central Bank
of Hesse. Bidder codes allow us to track each bidder over time. Hesse contains Germany’s
financial center Frankfurt hosting a major part of German banks including large banks as
well as a broad range of small private banks and foreign bank dependencies. Therefore, the
results derived from our sample should be fairly representative for the bidding behavior of
the German banking sector.
In many respects, banks’ bidding behavior in the repo auctions of the Bundesbank and
the ECB appear to be very similar, see Bindseil et al. (2004) and ECB (2001). First, large
bidders participate more often but their bids are still small relative to the total bid volume,
see Table 1. Second, banks usually do not submit more than three bids per auction, see
Table 2. In fact, the bid rate dispersion in the Bundesbank’s repo auctions is not higher
than in the repo auctions of the ECB, although there is no minimum bid rate that constrains
banks’ bidding. With a view to the large number of bidders, we are reluctant to interpret
the low bid rate dispersion in repo auctions as an indication of bidder collusion. Due to the
close relationship between the upcoming repo rate and the prevailing interest rates on the
interbank money market, it seems more plausible that bidders in repo auctions have similar
estimates regarding the auction outcome.4 Third, there are many bidders that participate
only infrequently, see Table 3. Only 175 out of 275 Hessian banks participated at least once
in the auctions covered by our data set. A similar share of active bidders is observed in the
repo auctions of the ECB. In contrast to previous empirical work, we do not remove the
bidders never participating in an auction to avoid distorting effects on the analysis of banks’
participation decision.
Compared with the ECB, which changed the auction format only once in 4 years, the
Bundesbank was far less reluctant to switch between fixed and variable rate tenders. In fact,
there is only one longer period, running from April to November 1995, where the Bundesbank did not change the auction format. In this period, the Bundesbank performed
its repo auctions exclusively as variable rate tender, which is the auction format used
4

For Treasury bill auctions, Gordy (1999) showed that higher uncertainty increases the number of bids per
bidder because bidder try to hedge against the winner’s curse by submitting multiple bids.

by the ECB since June 2000. We therefore concentrate on this period that provides 33
auctions with the standard maturity of about 2 weeks. Note that our sample period was
characterized by decreasing interest rates, see Fig. 1.5 In particular, in August 1995 the
Bundesbank lowered the rate of its marginal lending facility (the Lombard rate) by 50

Similarly, the ECB’s repo rates have decreased from 4.75% in Fall 2000 to 2% in July 2004.

basis points. With regard to banks’ underbidding in the repo auctions of the ECB, it will
be interesting to see how banks’ bidding is affected by the Bundesbank’s interest rate
cut.
3.2. Variables and theoretical predictions
Banks’ demand for repos should be affected by the cost of alternative refinancing opportunities. For example, the higher the spread defined as the difference between the expected
stop out rate and the overnight rate the cheaper is the repo credit. Therefore, a higher spread
should decrease both, the probability of bidding and the bid amount. We estimated the expected stop out rate using the error correction equation implied by the cointegrating relation
between the stop out rate and the overnight rate, see Appendix A.6
According to Bindseil et al. (2004), expectations of rate changes may have a strong
impact on banks’ bidding behavior. We measured the prevailing rate expectations by the
variable term spread defined as the difference between the 1-month rate and the overnight
rate. Following the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates, e.g. a negative
term spread shows that interest rates are expected to decline. In our sample period, the
Bundesbank changed its policy rate only once. According to the course of the term spread,
this reduction of the Bundesbank’s marginal lending rate in August 1995 was anticipated
by the banks. Banks’ bidding behavior in the auction preceding the Bundesbank’s rate cut
is of particular interest. We therefore introduce a dummy variable rate cut which is one in
6 Note that it would be more appropriate to define the opportunity cost variable using a money market rate
having the same maturity as the repo. Unfortunately, however, a biweekly money market rate, comparable to the
newly introduced EONIA swap rate, is not available for our sample period.

221

that particular auction and zero otherwise. This dummy variable should indicate whether
banks deviate systematically in their bidding behavior in the auction immediately before
the Bundesbank’s interest rate cut.
The interest rate uncertainty perceived at the auction day is proxied by the variable
volatility which is estimated using an EGARCH (1, 1) model for daily observations of the
overnight rate.7 Regarding the impact of uncertainty on banks’ bidding, the implications of
auction theory are generally ambiguous. On the one hand, there is the well-known winner’s
curse effect implying that banks bid more cautious when uncertainty increases. On the
other hand, higher uncertainty may also lead to higher bid rates and bid volumes if banks’
concern is rather to go out empty handed, see Scalia and Ordine (2003).8 There may also
be the “loser’s curse” effect which is related to the repo volume that is auctioned off,
see Pesendorfer and Swinkels (1997). However, since the repo volume supplied by the
Bundesbank was not preannounced but endogenously determined by the bids of the banks,
we could not include the auction size as an explanatory variable in our regressions.
The variable reserve fulﬁlment measures the liquidity need of the banking sector. Since
data on the individual reserve holdings are not available it is defined as the ratio of the
reserve holdings of all German banks prior to the auction and the aggregate minimum
reserve requirement. If reserve holdings are low, banks should have a stronger incentive to
participate in the auction. Since the Bundesbank allowed averaging over the maintenance
period, this effect might be particularly relevant in the last auction of the maintenance
period. We subsequently define the dummy variable end of period taking the value 1 if the
auction is the last in the maintenance period.
Finally, we consider two bidder-specific regressors. The variable maturing allotment is
defined as the log of a bank’s repo volume received 2 weeks before. This variable captures the
fact that banks often use the biweekly repo credit on a revolving basis. The dummy variables
large, medium, and small characterize a bank’s size with respect to the categorization of
banks used by the Deutsche Bundesbank, see Table 4. We will interact these dummies with all
explanatory variables to investigate how a bank’s bidding behavior is influenced by its size.
4. Empirical results
4.1. The participation decision of banks
In a first step, we analyze the participation decision of an individual bank using a panel
version of the logit model where the dependent variable yit equals one if bank i participates
in auction t ∈ {1, . . . , N} and is zero otherwise. Using the logistical distribution , the logit
model is given by

In line with, e.g. Nyborg et al. (2002) or Scalia and Ordine (2003), the EGARCH specification proved to be
most appropriate but the particular choice of the (G)ARCH model did not affect our results in a significant way.
8 This bidding behavior would also be in line with the predictions of multi-period reserve management models,
where higher interest rate risk increases banks’ demand for reserves, see Nautz (1998).

We opted for the random effects logit model since the Hausman-test could not reject
the hypothesis that the individual effects are uncorrelated with the other regressors. The
random effects model allows for the inclusion of time-invariant bidder-specific regressors
like the size dummies introduced above. Our specification is corroborated by the similarity
of the parameter estimates from the random and the corresponding conditional fixed effects
estimation, see Table 5.

Notes: The t-values of the parameter estimates are reported in parenthesis. For the significant parameters we
calculated the marginal effects (see Footnote 9) that indicate the economic significance of the variables by the usual
elasticity interpretation. Note that the conditional fixed effects estimation is restricted to banks which participate
at least twice. The Pseudo-R2 measure is calculated according to Aldrich and Nelson (1984).

223

Table 5 presents the estimation results indicating each variable’s impact on the participation probability. Yet, as in any nonlinear regression the estimated coefficients do not have
the familiar elasticity interpretation. To evaluate the parameter’s economic significance, we
report the corresponding marginal effects, see column 2.9
According to Table 5 interest rate expectations have a significant influence on a bank’s
participation decision. In line with the ECB’s experience, the participation probability in
the repo auctions of the Bundesbank decreases when a negative term spread indicates that
interest rates are expected to decrease. However, given the estimated marginal effect (0.879)
of the term spread the economic significance of rate expectations is only small. Fig. 1 shows
that the repo and the overnight rate fell in anticipation of a Lombard rate cut. Therefore, the
term spread could adjust smoothly and was generally much smaller than the actual rate cut.
Moreover, the insignificant coefficient of the rate cut dummy underlines that the expected
rate cut had no major impact on banks’ participation decision.
The variable spread measuring the opportunity costs of repos exhibits a significant effect
on banks’ participation decision and its coefficient is plausibly signed. For example, if the
expected repo rate of the central bank is high relative to the money market rate fewer banks
will decide to participate in the auction. The similarity of the estimated coefficients of the
spread and the term spread might suggest that the overnight rate cancels out. However, the
implied parameter restriction is strongly rejected by the data.
The coefficient of the variable volatility is significantly negative. Yet, the marginal effect
indicates that volatility’s influence on a bank’s participation decision is negligible. We are
therefore reluctant to interpret the coefficient as evidence in favor of the winner’s curse
effect. If banks are short in liquidity, i.e. their reserve fulﬁlment is low, they should have a
stronger incentive to participate in the auction. As in Scalia and Ordine (2003) this is not
substantiated by our data. This plausible effect might be obscured in our estimation because
we were left with aggregate data to proxy the liquidity position of an individual bank.
As expected, the variable maturing allotment has a positive effect on banks’ participation
demonstrating that banks use repos on a revolving basis. According to the estimated marginal
effect, a 70% rise in the volume of the maturing repo raises a bank’s participation probability
by 1% point. At a first glance, this effect appears to be small, but banks’ individual allotments
range between zero and 5 billion DM. Due to that large variation, the maturing allotment is a
major determinant of banks’ participation probability. For example, the average participation
probability of a bank with zero maturing allotment is about 7% while the average probability
jumps to 31% if the bank received only 1 million DM, the minimum allotment set by the
Bundesbank.
According to the estimated effect of the end of period dummy banks’ participation probability rises in the auctions performed in the last week of the maintenance period. Apparently,
banks bid more often at the end of the period anticipating the increased probability of being
squeezed after the auction, see Nyborg and Strebulaev (2001). The marginal effect indicates
that in the last auction of the reserve period the average participation probability of a bank
rises by 6% points.
9 Following Greene (2002), the marginal effect is calculated as ∂E[yit |xit ] = {(x β)[1 − (x β)]}β indicating

the percentage point change of the probability upon a 1% increase of the explanatory variables. Since its value
varies with x, the marginal effects are evaluated at the sample means of the regressors.

Finally, the coefficients of the size-dummies display the obvious fact that large banks
participate more frequently in the auctions than small banks, see also Table 4. Large banks
bid in the auction not only to satisfy their own liquidity needs but also to resale and actively
trade reserves in the secondary market.
4.1.1. Size effects on a bank’s participation
Central bank auctions are not designed to maximize the surplus of the central bank.
Therefore, size effects are of particular relevance for monetary policy because central banks
prefer ‘fair’ auction formats to avoid any violations of the principle of equal treatment.10 In
order to investigate whether a bank’s response to a regressor depends on its size, we interact
the size dummies with all other explanatory variables. The results are presented in the first
column of Table 6. In the second column we display the p-value of the Wald-statistics testing
for the null hypothesis of no size effect.11
There are significant size effects with regard to banks’ response to interest rate expectations (term spread) and to expected opportunity cost (spread). For both variables, the
medium-sized banks show the weakest response. The coefficients of the size-specific maturing allotment variables reflects that the seasonality of participating in an auction is more
pronounced for small and medium size banks than for large banks. This might imply that
larger banks can refinance themselves more easily on the interbank market and are less
dependent on a regular participation in central bank auctions.
In the last column of Table 6 we report the p-values of the tests on the overall significance
for each group of variables. The results of the extended logit model are very much in line with
those obtained for the model without size effects, see Table 5. In particular, the extended
logit model confirms the doubts on the significance of volatility for banks’ participation
decision. For the Bundesbank repo auctions, there is no evidence in favor of a size specific
winner’s curse effect in bidders’ participation decision.
4.2. The bid amount
In this section, we advance on the preceding analysis of bidders’ participation decision
investigating the determinants of an individual bank’s bid amount. Since a bank’s bid volume
can only be observed if the bank decides to participate in the auction, the variable bid amount
is left-censored. Ignoring this property of the data might result in biased estimates. Following
Ayuso and Repullo (2001), we therefore employ a panel tobit model that accounts for the
participation decision of each individual bank.
In the tobit model, the variable bid amount, yit∗ , is specified as
yit∗ = xit β + it

(2)

where
it ∼ N(0, σ 2 )
10

For the ECB, this is documented in the ECB’s guiding principles of the operational framework of monetary
policy, see http://www.ecb.int.
11 Since large banks participated in almost every auction, the corresponding coefficients can only be estimated
imprecisely, see Table 4.

Notice, that the tobit model uses both, the probability that yit = 0 (given xit ) and the distribution of yit given that it is positive. This can be illustrated by the log likelihood function

where  is the standard normal distribution. The first part of the log likelihood function
represents the information of the conventional regression on the uncensored observations
while the second part corresponds to the probit model describing a bank’s participation
decision. Obviously, the tobit estimation uses the full set of available information and
hence will generally lead to more efficient estimates.
Table 7 shows the estimated coefficients and the resulting marginal effects from the tobit
model explaining a bank’s bid amount.12 We also display the results of a corresponding
naive GLS panel regression which neglects the information contained in the zero bids. With
respect to the marginal effects of the tobit model, the results from the GLS regression seem
to be broadly in line with the tobit estimates. The general impression is, however, that the
GLS model exaggerates the effects of interest rate expectations, opportunity cost and the
reserve fulfillment. As expected, the standard deviations of the estimated coefficients are

larger in the GLS model. The only exception refers to the variable reserve fulﬁllment whose
significant coefficient implies that banks bid larger amounts when their liquidity needs are
low. This implausible bidding behavior is not confirmed by the tobit analysis.
Our findings are not in favor of a winner’s curse effect, i.e. bidders do not reduce their
bids significantly when the volatility of the market interest rate increases. There is, however,
a significant impact of the variables maturing allotment and end of period indicating that
bidders bid more aggressively when their demand for refinancing is high or the danger of
becoming squeezed increases.
The estimated coefficients of the term spread indicates that a bank’s bid amount decreases
when a negative term spread reveals that interest rates are expected to decrease. However,

228

corroborating the results obtained from the logit model, the marginal effect of the term
spread for the bid amount is only small. Moreover, the insignificant coefficient of the rate
cut dummy shows that the Bundesbank had no difficulties in supplying the intended volume
of reserves through its repo auction. Apparently, interest rate expectations did not impede
the Bundesbank’s money market management.
4.2.1. Size effects on the bid amount
Table 8 shows the results from the augmented tobit model that incorporates the interactions between the explanatory variables and the size dummies. The estimates reveal the
presence of size effects concerning the impact of the term spread on a bank’s bid amount.
Interestingly, the response of a bank’s bid amount to interest rate expectations is most
pronounced for small banks. This result seems to be in contrast to the ones obtained for
ECB’s auctions where large banks react stronger in case of expected changes of the repo
rate. According to Breitung and Nautz (2001) and Bindseil et al. (2004) this indicates that
large banks bid more informed and sophisticated than small banks in ECB’s repo auctions.
However, in the repo auctions of the Bundesbank, there is no advantage to postpone refinancing in times of rate cut expectations. As a consequence, there is no obvious explanation
for a marked impact of rate expectations on banks’ bidding. Probably, small banks react
stronger to the term spread since they are more likely to be squeezed after the auction. This
interpretation is substantiated by a significant end of maintenance period effect for small
and medium but not for large banks.
According to Table 8 there are significant size effects with regard to the variable maturing
allotment. This suggests that particularly small and medium sized banks use repos on
a revolving basis while large banks are more flexible in the their refinancing needs. In
particular, having better access to the interbank market, large banks might not depend as
strongly on the central bank refinancing as medium and small banks.

5. Conclusions
This paper analyzed a unique data set of individual demand schedules submitted in the
repo auctions of the Bundesbank. Given the mixed evidence on the role of rate expectations
and uncertainty documented in the empirical literature, we performed a panel analysis to
shed more light on bidder behavior in central bank auctions. In particular, we investigate
how interest rate expectations, opportunity cost, interest rate uncertainty, and bidder size
determine banks’ participation decision and its bid amount.
Our results confirm that interest rate expectations influence banks’ participation as well
as the submitted bid amount. However, in terms of the economic significance the impact of
interest rate expectations is only small. While rate cut expectations have led to underbidding
and even bidder strikes in the repo auctions of the ECB, bidders in the repo auctions of the
Bundesbank did not deviate systematically in their behavior before an anticipated rate cut.
In fact, in the Bundesbank auctions banks did not refrain from bidding but reacted to rate
cut expectations by bidding at lower interest rates.
The analysis of banks’ bidding behavior showed that the participation decision and the
submitted bid volume partly depend on a bank’s size. For example, size effects are significant

regarding the impact of a bank’s maturing allotment and the behavior of a bank at the end of
the reserve period. While the size effect found for the end-of-period dummy suggests that
small banks are more likely to be squeezed after the auction, the size-dependence impact
of a bank’s maturing allotment indicates that large banks are less dependent on a regular
participation in central bank auctions than medium and small banks.
In contrast to Treasury bill auctions, bidders’ response to interest rate uncertainty does
not support the winner’s curse effect in the Bundesbank repo auctions. In line with recent
findings on bidder behavior in the main refinancing operations of the ECB, this suggests that
bidder behavior in repo auctions is more closely related to banks’ private liquidity needs
and less influenced by common market conditions.

Appendix A. The expected stop out rate of the auction
Using weekly observations from April to November 1995, we found that the stop out
rate (r) and the interbank overnight rate (i) are cointegrated with a stationary spread. As a
consequence, the expected stop out rate is derived from an error correction equation which
is estimated as follows:
	rt = −0.007 − 0.121(r − i)t−1 + 0.662	rt−1 + ε̂t ,
