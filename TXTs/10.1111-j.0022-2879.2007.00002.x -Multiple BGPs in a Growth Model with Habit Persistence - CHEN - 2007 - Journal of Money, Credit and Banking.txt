Multiple BGPs in a Growth Model
with Habit Persistence
This paper establishes multiple balanced growth paths in an otherwise standard, competitive growth model without externality or distortions and with
households’ preference dependent upon how his/her consumption compares
to a habit stock formed by his/her own past consumption. The key feature
in our model is that consumption forms habits in combination with existing
habits. This model establishes multiple equilibria because habit persistence
induces an internal, intertemporal complementarity effect among consumption flows, with current consumption reinforcing future consumption. As a
result, there exist two balanced-growth paths, with one path exhibiting low
consumption and habits and high economic growth, and the other path exhibiting high consumption and habits and low growth that is not necessarily
a development trap. Both steady states are saddles, but global indeterminacy
arises where a high balanced growth path co-exists with a low balanced
growth path where the two equilibrium paths cannot be pareto ranked and
history need not matter for the selection of the equilibrium path.

RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN RESURGENT INTEREST in economic
growth models with multiple steady states. This strand is motivated by several empirical studies that document the existence of multiple development clubs (e.g., Baumol
and Wolff 1988, Quah 1996, Durlauf and Quah 1999). In accordance with the facts are
models in economic development that display poverty traps, where economies with
low initial capital stocks or incomes converge to a steady state with low per capita

income, while economies with high initial capital stocks converge to a different steady
state that corresponds to high per capita income.
The existing literature of economic development with multiple steady states may
be broadly classified into five lines. One line concerns models of club convergency
where countries differ in their initial level of human capital around different steadystate equilibria in the presence of social increasing returns to scale from human capital
formation (e.g., Azariadis and Drazen 1990) and capital market imperfection (e.g.,
Galor and Zeira 1993). A second line is the introduction of heterogenous agents so
that through income distribution, otherwise similar countries except for their initial
distribution of income may cluster around different steady-state equilibria (e.g., Galor
and Zeira 1993, Benabou 1996). A third line examines models of fertility choice and
a tradeoff between the time allocated to bearing and rearing children and the time
devoted to educating children, with the result that households find a large number
of children in their best interests, leading to an equilibrium with low per capita income (e.g., Becker, Murphy, and Tamura 1990, Galor and Weil 1996). A fourth line
is sectoral complementarities that may generate multiple steady-state equilibria due
to aggregate demand spillovers (e.g., Krugman 1991, Chen, Mo, and Wang 2002). 1
Finally, a fifth line investigates costly intermediation in which a participation externality, where the cost of financial intermediation depends negatively on the mass of
consumers, generates multiple steady states (e.g., Cooper and Ejarque 1995, Becsi,
Wang, and Wynne 1999). Except for few works, 2 all these studies incorporate some
forms of externality, which generate multiple long-run equilibria through an external
complementarity effect among households/investors.
This paper develops a model to establish multiple steady states with global indeterminacy in a standard one-sector unbounded growth model with habit consumption
and without relying on externality. The introduction of habit formation into the growth
model is motivated as follows. Empirical supports of the influences of habits on consumption have been made since Houthakker and Taylor (1970). The idea of habits in
preferences dates to Marshall (1898) and Duesenberry (1949). According to Duesenberry (1949), the source of variations in habit formation is a learning process which
begins in childhood, and a permanent shock will not change consumption behavior
too much in the short run, but over time an individual responds to it and reaches a new
consumption pattern that becomes habitual in the same way as the original pattern. 3
Ryder and Heal (1973) and Boyer (1975) have investigated the implication of habit
1. A static version of the line of research was pioneered by Rosenstein-Rodan (1943) and first formalized
by Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989).
2. These include Galor and Ryder (1989), Galor (1992), Galor and Weil (1996), and Shimomura (2004).
In a one-sector model by Galor and Ryder (1989) and a two-sector model by Galor (1992), they obtain
multiple steady states in overlapping-generations growth models, a framework where market participation
is limited to those consumers alive as noted in Cass and Shell (1973). While the steady states in Galor and
Weil (1996) are either locally a saddle or a sink but there is no global indeterminacy, all of the steady states
in our model are locally a saddle but global indeterminacy arises. Finally, Shimomura (2004) obtained
multiple steady states in a two-country trade model based upon negative income effects so the durable
good is a Giffen good for a range of its shadow price.

formation in the neoclassical optimal growth model, showing that the models lead to
richer dynamic behavior of consumption and other main variables around the steady
state. 4
Understanding consumption, and thus savings, has important bearings on aggregate activities and economic growth. Apparent data indicate excess smoothness of
aggregate consumption (Campbell and Deaton 1989, Fuhrer 2000). Moreover, data
also indicate that increases in economic growth cause subsequent increases in aggregate savings using both cross-country (Carroll and Weil 1994, Attainasio, Picci,
and Scorcu 2000, Rodrik 2000) and case studies (Paxson 1996, Deaton and Paxon
2000, Rodrik 2000). The data are mainly confined to East Asian countries. These
evidences favor the use of a utility with habits that exhibits consumption dynamics
consistent with the above facts. Recently there have been several empirical studies
that compared the model with habits in preference with the model without habits and
rejected the latter. 5 These evidences motivate the use of a model with consumption
habits in order to analyze the implications upon the long-run economic growth.
Specifically, our model generalizes the endogenous growth model of habits by
Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000) and of recursive preferences by Palivos, Wang, and
Zhang (1997) by allowing both current consumption flows and the existing habitual
stock to contribute to the increment of future habits. The generalization of habit
formation is important because it enables rich dynamics. This is an issue that has
not been thoroughly studied; while Carroll, Overland, and Weil focus on how habit
persistence implies that higher growth can induce more savings, Palivos, Wang, and
Zhang concentrate on recursive preferences of the form of Uzawa (1968).
Our general form of habit formation leads to a threshold ratio of consumption
to habit resulting in two balanced growth paths (hereafter BGP). This model creates
multiple BGPs for the following reasons. Existing habit enhances habit formation and
affects preferences. This feature induces an internal, intertemporal complementarity
effect, with current consumption reinforcing future consumption. High/low future
consumption is expected to be associated with high/low current consumption, in
order to attain a given level of utility for a household. Thus, for a given initial state,
a small disturbance may only lead the economy to shift locally to a new growth path
around the original BGP. However, it is also possible that a small disturbance may
also change the threshold significantly so that the economy converges globally to a

way as before . . . but he eventually will learn . . . and responds by buying cheap substitutes. . . . Eventually

studied economic dynamics while Alonso-Carrera, Caballe, and Raurich (2004) analyzed economic dynamics and optimal tax policies. The framework has been extended to an endogenous growth framework
recently (Carroll, Overland, and Weil 2000, Alonso-Carrera, Caballe, and Raurich 2001). Recent years
have seen applications in finance (Abel 1990, Constantinides 1990, Campbell and Cochrane 1999) and
business cycles (e.g., Mansoorian 1996, Ljungqvist and Uhlig 2000, Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher 2001).

new growth path around the other BGP. As one of the two BGPs has a higher longrun economic growth rate, such a small shock may lead to a large difference in the
economic growth rate in the long run.
While local dynamics are determinate (saddle) in our model, global indeterminacy
arises where there is a high balanced growth path co-existing with a low balanced
growth path that is not necessarily a development trap. Here the two equilibrium
paths cannot be pareto ranked and history need not matter for the selection of the
path. These features differentiate the results of our model from the aforementioned
studies with regard to two steady states. In some of these works, the steady states
are both saddle points and there exists a threshold level such that an initial condition
history determines the steady state to which an economy converges (e.g., Kurz 1968,
Palivos 1995, Galor 1996, Galor and Weil 1996). In the remaining works, one of
the steady states is a sink and the other is a saddle point, and globally, for most
given initial conditions an economy converges to the steady state that is a sink (e.g.,
Krugman 1991, Chen and Shimomura 1998).
In this paper, the theoretical model will be presented in the next section, while
Section 2 studies balanced-growth paths and transitional dynamics, and Section 3
investigates global indeterminacy. Concluding remarks are made in Section 4.

1. BASIC MODEL
Our basic model draws on Romer (1986), Palivos, Wang, and Zhang (1997), and
Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000). Consider an economy populated by households
and firms. There exists a continuum of infinite-lived, identical households, with no
population growth. There also exists a continuum of representative firms, with the
shares owned by households. It follows that the economy is a world of representative
household-producers.
1.1 Environment
The representative household is assumed to possess the following discounted, lifetime utility
 ∞
U=
e−ρt u(c(t)/S γ (t)) dt, ρ > 0, 0 < γ < 1,
(1a)
0

where u is the felicity function in t, c(t) is the instantaneous private consumption flow
in t, and S(t) is the habitual stock. Parameter γ indexes the importance of habits. If
γ = 0 then only the absolute level of consumption is important; while if γ = 1, then
consumption relative to the habitual stock is what matters. For values of γ between 0
and 1, both the absolute and relative levels are important. For this study, we assume
0 < γ < 1 so that absolute consumption level is not a consumer’s concern. To facilitate
the analysis, we have adopted a parametric felicity by assuming the following CES
functional form

BEEN-LON CHEN

u(c(t)/S γ (t)) = 1/(1 − σ )[(c(t)/S γ (t))1−σ − 1],

σ > 1.

:

29

(1b)

Assumption σ > 1 is crucial for the results of multiple interior steady states. The
presumption rules out the logarithmic felicity form, requiring one with curvature
steeper than a logarithmic form. Restriction σ > 1 is consistent with most empirical
findings that intertemporal elasticity of substitution is smaller than one.
The stock of habits is assumed to evolve according to
Ṡ = Bcµ (t)S 1−µ (t) − δs S(t),

1/2 < µ ≤ 1, S(0) > 0 given,

(2)

in which B > 0 represents a technology coefficient that forms past consumption flows
into habits, with δ s ≥ 0 describing how existing habitual stock depreciates. Thus, a
current consumption flow generates a long-lasting effect in a manner summarized by
the stock of habits.
equation (2) is more general than the specification in Carroll, Overland, and Weil
(2000). Here we follow other authors, such as Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and
Lettace and Uhlig (2000) to assume that consumption accumulates future habits
in relation to existing habitual stocks. More specifically, we assume that current
consumption flows contribute toward future habit formation, possibly in association
with existing habits; therefore, restriction µ ≤ 1 is made, 6 and to be consistent with
a perpetual growth framework the formation technology is assumed to be of constant
returns with respect to existing habits and current consumption. It should be remarked
that when B = δ s = 0, past consumption does not form the habitual stock. Then, the
model is reduced to a conventional one-sector, endogenous growth model (e.g., Romer
1986).
The representative firm is assumed to own the following production technology
y(t) = Ak(t),

k(0) > 0 given,

(3)

where y(t) is output, k(t) is capital stock, and A > 0 is a parameter. The technology
is abstracted from labor so capital should be interpreted broadly to include physical
as well as human capital (e.g., Rebelo 1991).
Finally, as households own firms’ shares, the representative household’s budget
constraint is
k̇ = y(t) − c(t) − δk k(t),

(4)

where δ k ≥ 0 is capital’s depreciation rate. This equation says that disposable income,
not consumed currently, becomes savings, which augments capital.
1.2 Optimization
The representative household’s problem is to choose consumption, in order to
maximize its discounted; lifetime utility (equations (1a and 1b)), subject to habitt

ual stock formation (equation (2)); production technology (equation (3)); and budget
constraints (equation (4)), taking existing capital stock k(t) and habits S(t) as predetermined. To solve the dynamic optimization problem, we define the following
current-value Hamiltonian
H (c, k, S, λk λs ) = 1/(1 − σ )[(c/S γ )1−σ − 1] + λk [Ak − c − δk k]
− λs [Bcµ S 1−µ − δs S],
where λ k and λ s denote the costate variables associated with equations (2) and (4),
respectively. We should note that the shadow price of habit stock, −λ s , is negative.
The negative shadow price on habit stocks reflects the fact that a greater initial habit
stock yields a lower utility flow for equation (1). Without abuse of terminology, in
what follows we call the absolute value of the shadow price of habit stocks, λ s , as
the shadow habit price. Although under σ > 1 the felicity is strictly concave in c(t),
for 0 < γ ≤ 1 it is not concave in S(t) as a higher existing habit stock lowers utility.
Since felicity function u is not concave in c and S, the Mangasarian sufficient theorem
cannot be used. Instead, we need to apply the Arrow sufficient theorem to guarantee
the concavity of the Hamiltonain (see Arrow and Kurz 1970). Denote
Ĥ (k, S, λk , λs ) = Max+ H (c, k, S, λk , λ S ).
{c∈R }

We have shown in the Appendix that when µ = 1, under a mild condition
Ĥ (k, S, λk (t), λs (t)) is concave in k and S for fixed values of λ k , λ k t. 7 For Case
µ < 1, as long as µ is large enough, by continuity a similar condition assures
Ĥ (k, S, λk (t), λs (t)) to be concave in k and S for fixed values of λ k , λ k , and t. Therefore, k∗ (t), S∗ (t), and c∗ (t) solve Problems (1)–(4). As Ĥ (k, S, λk (t), λs (t)) is not
strictly concave in k and S, therefore k∗ (t), S∗ (t), and c∗ (t) are not necessarily unique.
Denote ρ as the time-preference rate. Applying the Pontryagin maximum principle,
we obtain the following first-order conditions
(c/S γ )1−σ 1/c = λk − λs (BµS 1−µ /c1−µ ),

(5a)

A − δk = ρ − λ̇k /λk ,

(5b)

−(c/S γ )1−σ [γ /(λs S)] + δs − B(1 − µ)(cµ /S µ ) = λ̇s /λs − ρ.

(5c)

together with equations (2) and (4), and the transversality condition 8
Lim e−ρt H (t) = 0.

t→∞

(5d)

equation (5a) equates the marginal utility of current consumption to the marginal
costs of foregone savings, net of the effect via habit formation. Conditions (5b)
7. The condition is 1/(λδ S ) + B/δ S > 1(1 − 1/σ )[(1 − γ ) + γ /σ ]/[(1 + γ )(σ − 1)2 + γ ] + 1.

and (5c) are two Euler equations that equate the net marginal productivity of capital
stock, as well as the marginal utility of habitual stock, respectively, net of depreciation,
to the time-preference rate, net of their respective capital gains (or losses).

2. BALANCED GROWTH PATHS AND TRANSITIONAL DYNAMICS
We are now ready to analyze the competitive market equilibrium.
DEFINITION. A perfect-foresight equilibrium is a tuple { Ṡ/S(t), y(t)/S(t), k̇/k(t),
c(t)/S(t), k(t)/S(t), λs (t)/λk (t)} that satisfies

habitual stock formation; i.e., equation (2);
production technology; i.e., equation (3);
households’ budgets; i.e., equation (4);
representative household-firm optimization; i.e., equations (5a)–(5d).

To analyze the market equilibrium, we transform the economic system into a 3×3
system in three variables {x, λ, z}, where x ≡ c/S, λ ≡ λ s /λ k , and z ≡ k/S. By
keeping the relative shadow price in the system, our 3×3 system does not involve the
second-order time derivatives of consumption and is more simplified than the method
utilized in Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000). This solution method is in line with
Bond, Wang, and Yip (1996). In order to derive the three-variable system, first we
divide equation (5a) by equation (5c) to obtain
λ̇s /λs = δs + ρ − γ (x/λ) − B[1 − µ + µγ ]x µ .

(6a)

Next, differentiating equation (5a) with respect to time yields
[λ̇k /λk + γ (1 − σ ) Ṡ/S + σ ċ/c]
+ Bµ(λ/x 1−µ ){λ̇s /λs + [γ (1 − σ ) + (1 − µ)] Ṡ/S − (1 − σ − µ)ċ/c} = 0,
which, together with equations (2), (5b), and (6a), can be rewritten as
ċ/c = {(A − δk − ρ) + [γ (1 + (σ − 1)/µ)x/
λ − (ρ + µδ s + γ (σ − 1)δs ) + γ µBxµ ]Bµ(λ/x 1−µ )
+ γ (σ − 1)(B 2 µ(λ/x 1−2µ ) − δs )}/{σ + (σ + µ − 1)Bµ(λ/x 1−µ )},
(6b)
Notice that since (A − δ k ) is the marginal product of capital, expression ċ/c reduces
to the formulation in existing one-sector, endogenous growth models when B = µ =
0, with the long-run, intertemporal elasticity of substitution equal 1/σ . With B > 0
and µ > 0 for habit formation, equation (6b) suggests that in the long run, intertemporal elasticity of substitution is [σ + (σ + µ − 1)Bµ(λ/x 1−µ )]−1 , which for

32

:

MONEY, CREDIT AND BANKING

σ + µ > 1 is smaller than 1/σ , even for the case µ = 1. 9 Intuitively, current consumption forms habit stock that complements future consumption, thus lowering
intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption. Therefore, we obtain
PROPOSITION 1. An economy with habit formation with B > 0 and µ > 0 has a lower,
long-run, intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption than one without
habit formation.
Finally, the economic system cannot be analyzed without transforming the growing
variables into great ratios. We take differences between equations (6b) and (2), equations (6a) and (5b), and equations (4) and (2) to obtain the following 3×3 economic
system

ż/z ≡ k̇/k − Ṡ/S = A − (x/z) − δk − Bx µ + δs .

(7c)

Typically, a three-variable system is difficult to analyze. This is not the case here due
to the block-recursive nature of the system. Capital to habit ratio, z, enters the system
only through expression (7c); the other two equations form a separate subsystem in
x and λ. Thus, while consumption and thus x affects physical capital accumulation
and thereby the ratio of capital to habits, the ratio of capital to habits affects lifetime
utility and consumption only by determining the initial optimal choices of these
variables. Once these initial choices are made, λ and x evolve accordingly. More
specifically, while expressions (7a) and (7b) jointly determine {λ(t), x(t)}, expression
(7c) determines z(t). When the three-variable system is solved, all other endogenous
variables can be subsequently determined: Ṡ/S(t) is determined by equation (2),
y(t)/S(t) is determined by equation (3), k̇/k(t) is determined by equation (4), and
finally, the consumption growth rate, ċ/c(t), is determined by equation (6b). As a
result, the market equilibrium is completely determined.
2.1 Balanced Growth Paths
We now determine the balanced-growth path (BGP). A BGP is a steady-state, competitive market equilibrium, in which all variables grow at a constant rate over time.
9. This result is in contrast to the finding of the long-run, intertemporal elasticity being larger than 1/σ in
an economy with habit formation in Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000), which resorts to the second-order
time derivatives of c in order to derive the transitional dynamics of their economic system.

FIG. 1. Balanced Growth Paths

Therefore, ẋ = λ̇ = ż = 0 in the steady state. We determine the BGP by investigating
the shape of loci summarized by expressions (7a)–(7c) in two planes.
First, we start with Locus λ̇ = 0 in a (λ, x) plane. Differentiating Expression (7b)
with respect to x and λ, we find Locus λ̇ = 0 is upward sloping. Moreover, we find
that Locus λ̇ = 0 starts from the origin and approaches horizontal line x = e ≡ {(A +
δ s − δ k )/[B(1 − (1 − γ ) µ)]}1/µ > 0, when λ approaches infinity (see Figure 1).
Next, in order to analyze the shape of Locus ẋ = 0, we consider
Condition R: (σ − 1)(1 − γ )δs > ρ.
Condition R is easy to meet as ρ is a small value at less than 4% while σ is a large
number, more than 1 in calibration. Note that for γ < 1 Condition R implies (σ −
1)(1 − γ δ s ) > ρ. Under Condition R there is a positive threshold separating the
behavior for Locus ẋ = 0. Differentiating Locus ẋ = 0 yields

We examine some special cases as follows.

MONEY, CREDIT AND BANKING

First, when µ → 0 and γ → 0, we obtain a ∗11 = − (σ − 1 − ρ)(λ/x) − σ < 0 and
≡ − ρ (σ − 1)(B − δ s ) < 0.
Then, Locus ẋ = 0 is positively sloping if the locus exists. The problem with µ → 0
is that equation (7a) becomes ẋ/x = (A − δk − ρ)/σ − [1 − γ (σ − 1)/σ ](B − δs ),
so ẋ is usually not zero and Locus ẋ = 0 does not exist. The economic system must
be transformed in a different way. The model is then reduced to Rebelo (1991).
Second, restricting µ > 0, when γ → 0, we find

a ∗12

a ∗12 ≡ − [ ρ − (σ − 1) δ s + B(σ + µ − 1)x µ ] < (>) 0 if x > (<) x̂, where
x̂ ≡ {[(σ − 1)δs − ρ]/[B(σ + µ − 1)]}1/µ > 0 if σ > 1, and
a ∗11 ≡ λ/x{− [B(σ + µ − 1)(2µ − 1)]x µ − [(σ − 1) − ρ]} − σ .
When µ is large enough, it is easy to show that a ∗11 < − σ < 0. 10
Finally, allowing for both µ > 0 and γ > 0, the sign of a ∗12 remains dependent on
whether x is larger or smaller than the threshold x̂, and the sign of a ∗11 , by continuity,
is negative if µ is large enough.
Thus, under Condition R if µ > 0 is large enough, Locus ẋ = 0 slopes negatively
when x ≥ x̂, and positively when x ≤ x̂ and is thus not a monotonic locus as illustrated
in Figure 1. Moreover, for x ≥ x̂, we have shown that Locus ẋ = 0 has an infinite
slope and has the x axis as the asymptote when x approaches infinity, and Line x = x̂
as the asymptote when λ approaches infinity. Alternatively, for x ≤ x̂, Locus ẋ = 0
intersects the x axis at the region [0, x 0 ], where x 0 ≡ {[A − (δ k + ρ) − (σ +
γ (σ − 1))δ s ]/{B[σ (1 − γ ) + γ (1 − µ)]}}1/µ > 0, with a positive slope at Point (0,
x 0 ), 11 and approaches Line x = x̂ when λ approaches infinity.
Given the shapes of Loci λ̇ = 0 and ẋ = 0 in Figure 1, as e > x̂, 12 these two loci
have two interior intersections. 13 Therefore, there exist two interior BGPs, as indicated
by points H and L in the figure, with BGP H having a higher ratio of consumption to
habits and a higher ratio of habit price to capital price, while BGP L having a lower
ratio of consumption to habits and a lower ratio of habit price to capital price.
As is clear, the equilibrium with two steady states emerges from the existence
of the threshold. The threshold in the model makes Locus ẋ = 0 opposite in the
slope when the locus is located above or below the threshold. The threshold arises
from two internal, intertemporal complement effects. One is the habit in preference,
represented by γ , and the other is the complement of current habits in forming new
habits, represented by 1 − µ, so that consumption accumulates future habits in relation
to existing habitual stocks. When the habit stock is small relative to consumption so
the ratio of consumption to habits is above the threshold, the two complement effects
are weak so that a ∗12 < 0, i.e., the growth rate of the ratio of consumption to habits

decreases in the ratio of the shadow price of habits to the shadow price of capital.
Alternatively, when the ratio of consumption to habits is below the threshold, the two
complement effects are strong so that a ∗12 > 0.
Finally, in order to compare the economic growth rate for the two BGPs, we analyze
Locus ż = 0.
We find that the slope of Locus ż = 0 is positively sloping and, moreover, is concave
in a (x, z) plane. Therefore, BGP H is associated with a higher ratio of capital to habit
stock, while BGP L is associated with a lower ratio of capital to habit.
The economic growth rate can be rewritten using equation (4), along with equation (3), to obtain
k̇/k = ẏ/y = A − δk − x ∗ /z ∗ .

(9)

Therefore, k̇/k, and thus ẏ/y, is decreasing in x/z. Notice that the ratio of consumption to habits relative to the ratio of capital to habits is just the ratio of consumption to
capital, c/k. Since the long-run x/z in BGP H is xH /z H , which is smaller than xL /z L
in BGP L, the long-run, economic growth rate in BGP H is thereby larger than in BGP
L. Since relationship xH /z H >xL /z L implies cH /kH < cL /kL , the ratio of consumption
to capital is lower for BGP H. As lower consumption in BGP H leads to slower habit
accumulation, the price of habit is thus higher in BGP H, resulting in λ H > λ L in
Figure 1.
The reasons for two possible equilibrium paths for an initial state are as follows.
With the consumption habit in preferences, a household’s higher current consumption
is expected to lead to higher future consumption, in order for a ratio of consumption
to habit to attain a given level of utility. This effect induces an interaction among
consumption flows, with current consumption reinforcing future consumption. When
an agent expects to gain a certain utility level in the future, s/he may choose optimally
to consume more now. As high current consumption forms more habits, s/he has to
consume more in the future to have a proper ratio of consumption to habit in order to
obtain the desired utility level. Alternatively, s/he could optimally choose to consume
little now and in the future, in order to obtain the same utility level. As a result, there
are two possible long-run equilibrium paths for consumption, with high/low future
consumption expectations leading to high/low current consumption choices, and all
the equilibrium paths are consistent with expectations in equilibrium. Consequently,
habits are formed faster in the equilibrium path associated with high consumption
than in the equilibrium path associated with low consumption, while capital stock is
accumulated slowly in the former equilibrium path, and faster in the latter equilibrium
path. As an effect of capital accumulation, the economic growth rate is low in the
steady state of the former equilibrium path, and high in the latter equilibrium path.
2.2 Transitional Dynamics
We now proceed to analyze the dynamic properties of the three-variable system
by examining its transitional dynamics. The transitional dynamics of the economic
system can be analyzed if we linearize the dynamic system of Expressions (7a)–(7c),
evaluated at a BGP {x∗ , λ∗ , z∗ }, to yield

As the dynamic system of Expressions (7a)–(7c) involves one state variable, z, and
two control variables, x and λ, there exists a unique equilibrium saddle path toward
a BGP if the number of negative eigenvalues near the BGP is one, and there exists a
continuum of equilibrium paths toward a BGP if the number of negative eigenvalues
near the BGP is larger than one.
Denote J as the Jacobean matrix in equation (10) and θ as its eigenvalues. When
we subtract matrix J from matrix θ I, where I is an identity matrix of order 3, then the
eigenvalues are determined by equating determinant |J − θ I| to zero. If we expand
|J − θI| = 0, we obtain the following characteristic function:
[θ 2 − (a11 + a22 )θ + (a11 a22 − a21 a22 )](θ − a33 ) = 0.
Solving the above polynomial function yields the following three eigenvalues:

θ1 = [(a11 + a22 ) − (a11 + a22 )2 − 4(a11 a22 − a12 a21 )]/2 < 0,

θ2 = [(a11 + a22 ) + (a11 + a22 )2 − 4(a11 a22 − a12 a21 )]/2 > 0,
θ3 = x ∗ /z ∗ > 0.
Given a 11 < 0, a 21 < 0, and a 22 > 0, and in the neighborhood of
BGP
H, a 12 < 0, we obtain a 11 a 22 − a 12 a 21 < 0. Then, (a11 + a22 ) <

(a11 + a22 )2 − 4(a11 a22 − a12 a21 ) > 0, and thus, θ 1 < 0 < θ 2 for BGP H. On

the other hand, a 12 > 0 in the neighborhood of BGP L. As the slopes of both Loci
ẋ = 0 and λ̇ = 0 are positive and the latter, − a 22 /a 21 > 0, is steeper than the former,
−a 12 /a 11 > 0, we obtain a 11 a 22 − a 12 a 21 < 0, and thus θ 1 < 0 < θ 2 for BGP L.
Therefore, there is only one negative root around each BGP, and both BGPs are saddle
points. Consequently, there is a unique dynamic growth path toward any one of the
two BGPs. In Figure 2, Path DD is the unique saddle path toward BGP H, while Path
FF is the unique saddle path toward BGP L.
In the (z, x) plane, if we draw a horizontal auxiliary line from x̂, it intersects the
ż = 0 locus. We call the intersection point M and the corresponding value of z = ẑ.
Path SS is the unique saddle path, and it is discontinuous at the threshold ż. For any
initial z(0) < ẑ, say at z(0) a in Figure 2, x must jump to the Saddle SS and converge
to x L in the long run; for any z(0) > ẑ, say at z(0) b in Figure 2, x must jump to the
Saddle SS and converge to x H in the long run.
Summarizing the BGP and transitional dynamics, we obtain
PROPOSITION 2. In an economy with habit formation, under Condition R, if µ > 0 is
large enough there exist two BGPs that are saddles, with one having higher economic
growth rates and the other, lower economic growth rates.
Previous papers with path-dependent utility may have two nondegenerate steadystate equilibria (under the exogenous growth framework), but one stationary point
is a saddle and the other is a sink (e.g., Krugman 1991, Palivos 1995, Galor and
Weil 1996). If both steady states are saddles, history, or predetermined state variables
govern the steady state to which the equilibrium moves. However, although both
steady states are saddles in our model, history need not select the equilibrium path.

As is clear in the next section, global indeterminacy arises in that starting from an
initial state in the neighborhood of one BGP the economy may move toward the
neighborhood of the other BGP. As a result, although the low- and the high-growth
equilibria are saddles, the low-growth equilibrium is not necessarily a development
trap.

3. GLOBAL INDETERMINACY
We analyze the global indeterminacy of small disturbances. As an illustrative example, we investigate two disturbances, with one in relation to habits and the other
in relation to productivity. Specifically, we consider faster habit formation (a higher
B) and larger productivity (a higher A) and envisage the equilibrium dynamics. Then,
we analyze the saving rates in the short run and in the long run. Finally, we extend the
model and consider endogenous rates of time preference so that global indeterminacy
is eliminated.
3.1 When More Habits Are Formed by Consumption
Suppose that the economy is originally at high-growth equilibrium, with a BGP
at H z and thus the initial state z H (0) larger than the threshold, ż (Figure 3). When
a given level of consumption forms more habits, Loci ẋ = 0, λ̇ = 0, and ż = 0 all
shift downward. As a result, an agent reduces consumption instantaneously (to A) so
the ratio of habit price to capital price increases instantaneously (to H 1 ). As lower

FIG. 3. A Faster Habit Formation (Higher B): Global Dynamics

BEEN-LON CHEN

:

39

consumption in the short run leads to more capital accumulation, the ratio of capital
to habit increases along Saddle SA SA over time (to HBz ). Moreover, the ratios of
consumption to habit and of habit price to capital price move along path DD (to HB ).
Thus, the ratios of capital to habit and of consumption to habit are larger in the long
run.
However, when the habit formation coefficient is increased so Locus ż = 0 shifts
downward significantly, the threshold, x̂ and thus ẑ, may be reduced to ẑ 

 . Then,
the initial state z H (0) is smaller than the threshold, ẑ 
 . As a result, the agent reduces
consumption a lot instantaneously (to B) in order to slow down the formation of
habitual stock. Over time, as habit is formed faster than capital formation, the ratio
of capital to habit is reduced to LBz (along Saddle SB SB ), and the ratio of habit price
to capital price decreases (along path FF). Consequently, all three ratios are smaller,
rather than larger, in the long run.
3.2 Increased Productivity: Global Dynamics
Next, we consider a large productivity. Suppose that the economy is originally at
low-growth equilibrium, with a BGP at L z and the initial state z L (0) smaller than
the threshold ẑ (Figure 4). When productivity is increased, Loci ẋ = 0, λ̇ = 0, and
ż = 0 all shift upward. Anticipation of higher income increases consumption instantaneously resulting in a higher ratio of consumption to habit (A), and the consequent
accumulation of habits reduces the ratio of habit price to capital price (to L1 ). Over
time, the ratio of capital to habit is decreased (resp. increased) along Saddle SA SA
(to LA
z ) if Locus ẋ = 0 shifts leftward less (resp. more) than Locus λ̇ = 0. The ratios
of habit price to capital price and of consumption to habits move along path FF (to

FIG. 4. A Larger Productivity (Higher A)

40

MONEY, CREDIT AND BANKING

AA ). In the new BGP, the ratio of capital to habit is decreasing in the long run, while
the ratios of consumption to habit and of habit price to capital price may be larger
or smaller than that of the original BGP. The effect on the economic growth rate in
the new BGP is in general positive as there is a positive direct effect that generally
dominates the ambiguous indirect effect through changing the ratio of consumption
to capital.
However, when productivity is increased so Locus ż = 0 shifts upward significantly,
the threshold ẑ is reduced to ẑ 
 that is smaller than the initial state, z L (0). As a result,
consumption increases instantaneously so the ratio of consumption to habits is at B
in equilibrium. As income is higher, capital is accumulated faster than habits so that
the ratio of capital to habits increases along Saddle SB SB over time (to HBz ), and as a
result, the ratio of habit price to capital price increases along path DD over time (to
HB ). In the new BGP, all three ratios are increasing in the long run. The economic
growth rate is higher through a positive direct effect and a positive indirect effect via
a lower ratio of consumption to capital.
3.3 Short-run and Long-run Savings Rates
Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000) derived the condition under which the derivative
of the gross savings rate with respect to the growth rate of output in steady state is
positive. They found that habit formation increases the range of parameter values
for the relationship to be positive. It seems natural to characterize the short-run and
long-run savings rate around the high and low equilibrium.
According to equation (4), the savings rate in our model is
χ(t) ≡ [y(t) − c(t)]/y(t) = [k̇ − δk k(t)]/Ak(t) = (1/A)[k̇/k(t) − δk ],
where, from equation (9), k̇/k(t) is inversely related to the ratio of consumption to
capital.
The savings rate depends upon the location of initial state. Suppose the economy
is initially either at z(0) a or at z(0) b in Figure 2. Then, the initial equilibrium is J and
G, respectively. As the ratio of consumption to capital at G is smaller than the ratio
of consumption to capital at J, the savings rate at G is larger than the savings rate at
B
 in the short run.
In the long run, the economy initially at z(0) a moves from A
 along Saddle SS
to L z , the low-growth BGP, while the economy initially at z(0) b moves from B
 to
H z , the high-growth BGP in Figure 2. As the ratio of consumption to capital at H z
is smaller than that at L z , the savings rate of the economy initially at z(0) b is higher
than the economy initially at z(0) a in the long run. As a result, there is a possibility
that an economy with a higher savings rate in the short run has a lower savings rate
in the long run.
Moreover, there is global indeterminacy. A small disturbance may change the
economic structure so that the threshold changes significantly, according to Figures 3
and 4. Thus, the economy initially at z(0) a in Figure 2 may move to a BGP in the

BEEN-LON CHEN

:

41

neighborhood of H z while the economy initially at z(0) b may move to a BGP in the
neighborhood of L z . As a consequence, the savings rate in the economy initially at
z(0) b is lower, rather than higher, than the economy initially at z(0) a in the long run.
To summarize global indeterminacy, we obtain
PROPOSITION 3. In an economy with habit formation, under Condition R and if µ >
0 is large enough, a small disturbance may change the economic structure so global
indeterminacy arises. As a result, the economic growth rate and the saving rate are
globally indeterminate.
A remark must be made for the low long-run growth BGP in our model. The lowgrowth BGP is not interpreted as a development trap. Existing works interpreted a
long-run low-growth equilibrium as a trap because it is locally a sink and thus, once
the economy is in the neighborhood of the long-run equilibrium it is difficult to move
toward another long-run equilibrium (e.g., Krugman 1991, Galor and Weil 1996).
The low long-run BGP in our model is locally a saddle, and globally it may move to
the high long-run BGP and is thus not a development trap.
3.4 Extension: Endogenous Rates of Time Preferences
Global indeterminacy arises in this model because of the following two features: the
internal, intertemporal complementarity effect and the existence of two steady states.
If the threshold is not feasible, we rule out the existence of two steady states. Then, the
equilibrium with two steady states exhibiting global indeterminacy is reduced to the
equilibrium with a unique steady state exhibiting global determinacy. The existence
of two steady states is ruled out if Condition R no longer holds.
Suppose that the rate of time preference is not constant but is endogenous in the
sense of Uzawa (1968). Specifically, following Palivos, Wang, and Zhang (1997),
we assume ρ = ρ(u(x S 1−γ )), with ρ 
 (u) > 0 and ρ(u) reaching asymptotically an
upper bound ρ̄ > (σ − 1)(1 − γ )δs . Then, ρ = ρ(u) may increase over time when
there is a positive, even small, economic growth rate so that S increases over time.
Eventually, ρ(u) increases to a level that Condition R fails to meet. As a result,
eventually the threshold x̂ < 0 in Figures 1 and 2 and the steady state L are thus
not feasible. Therefore, the equilibrium with two steady states disappears, while the
equilibrium with a unique steady state emerges. The unique steady state is both locally
and globally determinate. Global indeterminacy is eliminated and history determines
the fates of economies.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we have analyzed a simple competitive, one-sector, endogenous
growth model that has been extended to allow for a utility function exhibiting habit
persistence in preferences. The key feature in our model is that consumption forms

42

:

MONEY, CREDIT AND BANKING

consumption habits in combination with existing habits. We use a standard solution
procedure for a three-variable dynamic system without involving second-order time
derivatives for consumption in the system. Habit persistence in preferences brings
forth a non-linear economic system resulting in two interior balanced growth paths,
with one exhibiting low consumption and habit formation and high economic growth,
and the other displaying high consumption, high habit formation, and low economic
growth.
The two steady states are saddle points locally, but for an initial ratio of capital
and habits global indeterminacy arises with a high balanced growth path co-existing
with a low balanced growth path such that history need not matter for the selection of
the equilibrium path. Moreover, the two equilibrium paths cannot be pareto ranked
and the low growth BGP is not a trap. We have investigated the global indeterminacy
under two disturbances, one pertaining to habit formation and the other to productivity.
In addition, we have analyzed the resulting implications on short-run and long-run
savings rate and an extension to endogenous rates of time preference in order to
eliminate global indeterminacy.
Finally, there are restrictions in the model and for simplicity we point out just
one. In the model both BGPs have long-run positive economic growth rates. The
model can only be used to highlight the epoch of sustained economic growth after the
industrialization. Such a model is thus a non-unified growth theory in the language
of Galor (2005). In order to interpret the growth process over the entire history of
the human species from the state of Malthusian stagnation to the post-Malthusian
regime and then the sustained regime, the model needs modification. To do that,
following Galor and Weil (2000), Galor and Moav (2002) and Galor (2005), we
may consider the fertility choice, endogenous labor supply, education choice, and
technical progress, along with other building blocks like the Malthusian elements and
the Darwin elements. We may then analyze how the habit in preference affects the
growth dynamics and process over the entire economic growth history. This points to
a direction for further research.
