The Seven Percent Solution
HSUAN-CHI CHEN and JAY R. RITTER*
ABSTRACT
Gross spreads received by underwriters on initial public offerings (IPOs) in the
United States are much higher than in other countries. Furthermore, in recent
years more than 90 percent of deals raising $20-80 million have spreads of exactly
seven percent, three times the proportion of a decade earlier. Investment bankers
readily admit that the IPO business is very profitable, and that they avoid competing on fees because they "don'twant to turn it into a commodity business." We
examine several features of the IPO underwriting business that result in a market
structure where spreads are high.

IT IS WIDELYACCEPTED
THATthere are fixed costs associated

with issuing

se-

curities, leading to economies of scale in the costs of issuing debt, equity, and
hybrid securities. For initial public offerings (IPOs) of moderate size, however, no economies of scale are evident when one examines the commissions
paid to investment bankers, also known as the gross spreads or underwriting discounts. In the period from 1995 to 1998, for the 1,111 IPOs raising
between $20 and $80 million in the United States, more than 90 percent of
issuers paid gross spreads of exactly seven percent.
This clustering of spreads at seven percent has not always been present.
There is much more clustering at seven percent now than a decade ago,
although the average spread on IPOs has not changed during this period. In
the 1985 to 1987 period, only about one-quarter of moderate size IPOs had
spreads of exactly seven percent, in contrast to the more than 90 percent
incidence that has prevailed in recent years. We offer a few ideas about this
pattern, but the convergence remains puzzling.
Spreads on IPOs outside of the United States, such as in Australia, Japan,
Hong Kong, or Europe, are approximately half the level of those in the United
States. Spreads within the United States for bond, convertible bond, and
seasoned equity offerings do not show pronounced clustering on one number.'

The Journal of Finance

This article examines several possible explanations for the high average
spreads on IPOs in the United States, the striking fact that so many issuers
pay exactly 7.0 percent, and the increase in clustering during the past decade. We argue that the spreads for most deals above $30 million are above
competitive levels. One reason for this opinion is that the spreads are much
higher than elsewhere in the world. A second reason is that if spreads were
determined primarily by costs, the average spreads on $80 million deals
would be lower than on $20 million deals. But they are not. And if costs were
the main determinant of spreads, $40 million deals by risky companies would
have higher spreads than $40 million deals by relatively easy to value firms.
But they do not. A third reason for our opinion is that investment bankers
readily concede that the spreads are high, "The fact is, we'd be cutting our
own throats to compete on price."2
Ideally, we would like to have cost information to directly test whether the
gross spreads that are charged are equal to costs, including a competitive
rate of return on capital employed. Unfortunately, this information is proprietary. More importantly, there would be problems in interpreting the numbers, since many of the costs are hard to allocate, and the costs of operating
a gold-plated operation are higher than for a bare-bones operation. In other
words, the costs are endogenous. High spreads induce underwriters to compete for business by adding more services.
There are several features of the IPO underwriting market that are conducive to high spreads. The importance of underwriter prestige results in a
"pecking order" where few issuers will turn down a "bulge bracket" underwriter for a less prestigious one, even if it means paying higher fees. The
importance of analyst coverage limits the number of viable competitors for a
given deal, and leads issuing firms to choose a lead underwriter at least
partly on the basis of characteristics unrelated to the fees charged.
Explanations that we address for the high average spreads, and the high
frequency of seven percent spreads, include the possibility of implicit or explicit collusion among investment bankers. Among game theorists, the term
"implicit collusion" is used to denote an outcome in which sellers keep prices
above competitive levels without explicitly colluding. Because the term "implicit collusion" is sometimes interpreted in a conspiratorial manner, we will
use the term "strategic pricing." In the strategic pricing explanation, individual underwriters realize that by undercutting spreads to win a deal, competitors will respond by charging lower spreads in the future, resulting in a
lower present value of profits. The self-interest of each individual investment banker results in higher spreads than if the fees were at competitive
levels. By competitive levels, we mean spreads where no economic profits
are being earned by underwriters. The logic is based on the Dutta and Madhavan (1997) model of a noncooperative game used to explain the high bidask spreads on Nasdaq stocks.

We also discuss several other, more innocuous, reasons why IPO spreads are
high. These reasons include the necessity of having high spreads in order to
induce underwriters to do a credible job of certifying the quality of an offering.
Further, although spreads are the primary direct compensation of underwriters, the money "left on the table" via the short-run underpricing of IPOs
is an important indirect compensation, for underwriters are able to allocate
this money to their favored clients. Alternatively, low spreads would encourage greater underpricing as a way of reducing the expected costs of stabilizing
IPOs, thereby increasing the indirect costs to issuing firms. Yet another reason is that high spreads induce underwriters to compete for business on the
basis of analyst coverage, which enhances the liquidity of a company's stock.
There are some similarities between patterns of gross spreads on IPOs
and those of Nasdaq bid-ask spreads. Prior to the publicity generated by
Christie and Schultz (1994), Nasdaq market makers avoided odd-eighth quotes.
In other words, quotes at $10, $10.25, and $10.50 were far more common
than quotes at $10.125, $10.375, and $10.625. Various parties have argued
that the avoidance of odd-eighth quotes facilitated either implicit or explicit
collusion to keep the bid-ask spreads wide. (The evidence of explicit collusion
was strong enough to result in a lawsuit settlement of $1.03 billion paid by
Nasdaq market makers in November 1998.) In the IPO market, the avoidance of spreads that are not exactly seven percent could facilitate either
explicit collusion or strategic pricing, in that it is readily observable (from
the prospectus) whether one underwriter is charging a fee that is "too low."
On the other hand, there is a tendency to have at least some clustering at
integers in almost every market, including the London gold market and interest rates paid on bank deposits (Kahn, Pennacchi, and Sopranzetti (1999))
in spite of no requirement to avoid noninteger prices.
Explanations for the increased clustering over time are harder to come by.
We conjecture that seven percent has arisen as a focal point partly because
issuers have placed relatively little attention on fees, and underwriters find
it easy to justify a given spread by pointing to previous deals done at the
same spread.
The structure of the remainder of this article is as follows: In Section I, we
present the facts on the distribution of gross spreads on IPOs in the United
States over the 1985 to 1998 period. In Section II, we discuss features of the
IPO market that may facilitate high spreads. In Section III, we discuss alternative explanations for the clustering of spreads at seven percent. In Section IV, we discuss possible reasons for the increased clustering of spreads
over time. Section V concludes this article.
I. The Facts
A. Data
We examine the spreads on 3,203 firm commitment IPOs from January
1985 to December 1998 covered in the New Issues database of Securities
Data Company (SDC). Closed-end funds, American Depository Receipts (ADRs),

real estate investment trusts (REITs), and unit offerings are excluded from
the sample. The sample is restricted to equity IPOs with domestic gross
proceeds of at least $20 million because the compensation for underwriting
smaller offerings is much higher due to the diseconomies of scale, and these
deals may be accompanied with underwriter warrants.3 Throughout the paper, the proceeds exclude overallotment options, and are expressed in terms
of dollars of 1997 purchasing power adjusted using the U.S. GDP implicit
price deflator.4 It is worth noting that in the United States, buyers of IPOs
pay no brokerage commission.
B. Empirical Evidence of the Clustering of Underwriting Spreads
at Seven Percent
Table I reports the number of offerings by calendar year, offering size, and
gross spread. The table shows that the proportion of IPOs with a seven
percent spread has an upward trend until 1995, then stabilizes at about
77 percent. For deals with proceeds of $20 million up to $80 million, which
we refer to as moderate size deals, the increasing concentration at seven
percent is especially noteworthy. This is illustrated in Figure 1.
At the bottom of Table I we report the distributions after aggregating the
years into three time periods: 1985 to 1987, 1988 to 1994, and 1995 to 1998.
We also report the numbers by proceeds category: moderate size deals and
large deals. In the 1985 to 1987 period, 26 percent of the moderate size IPOs
occurred at seven percent, with 46 percent at lower spreads and 28 percent
at higher spreads. By the 1995 to 1998 period, only five percent of these
deals occurred at lower spreads, and only four percent occurred at higher
spreads. Fully 91 percent of these moderate size IPOs paid a spread of exactly 7.0 percent.
Although the clustering of spreads has increased over time, in Table II we
show that the average spread has remained virtually unchanged over the
last 14 years.5 This includes not only high-volume periods, but also the lowvolume years following the October 1987 stock market crash. During the
1988 to 1990 period when there was relatively little equity-issuing activity,
presumably there was plenty of excess capacity in the underwriting business.
In Figure 2, we show a scattergram of the relation between spreads and
the logarithm of proceeds for IPOs from 1998. The figure shows the strong
clustering of spreads at seven percent for deals with proceeds of $20 million

than $80 million (expressed in terms of dollars of 1997 purchasing power) before the exercise of
the overallotment option. Closed-end funds, REITs, ADRs, and unit offerings are excluded from

below seven percent, seven percent, and above seven percent. The percentage of IPOs in each

(log(20) = 3.00) to $80 million (log(80) = 4.38). In Figure 3, we show the
scattergram of the relation between spreads and proceeds for the subset of
the deals with proceeds of less than $100 million, without logging the proceeds.
As reported in Table I, of the 1,111 moderate size IPOs in the 1995 to 1998
period, 56 had spreads of less than seven percent, and 45 had spreads of
more than seven percent, according to SDC. Inspection of these 101 nonseven percent IPOs reveals that 38 of them had spreads different from 7.0 percent because of "rounding errors." Although there is no requirement that
spreads be expressed as pennies per share, if a firm has an offer price of
$13.50 per share, the spread tends to be either 94 cents (6.963 percent) or
95 cents (7.037 percent), rather than the 94.5 cents that would make the
percentage spread equal to 7.0 percent. If we classify these cases as seven
percent spreads, there are only 63 of the 1,111 moderate size IPOs with
non-seven percent spreads. On closer inspection, we find that several of
these 63 were ADRs of foreign firms that were misclassified by SDC, several
were Canadian companies, 11 were IPOs where the spreads were lower than
seven percent but the expected proceeds from the preliminary prospectus

indicated an intention to raise at least $80 million, and five were IPOs where
the spreads were higher than seven percent but the expected proceeds from
the preliminary prospectus were less than $20 million. (The spread is generally negotiated before the preliminary prospectus is issued.) This leaves
only about 40 of the 1,111 moderate size IPOs with non-seven percent spreads.
Thus, in the 1995 to 1998 period, the clustering of spreads at seven percent
is actually even more extreme than the 91 percent of moderate size deals

least 96 percent of IPOs with expected proceeds of $20 to 80 million paid
seven percent spreads.6
C. Spreads in Other Countries
Spreads on IPOs in other countries are much lower than in the United
States. For example, the March 19, 1997 IPO of Cambridge Antibody Technology in the United Kingdom, underwritten by Kleinwort, raised $66 million (U.S.$) with a 3.36 percent spread (composed of a 3.0 percent commission
plus a 150,000 pound fee), according to SDC.7 In Japan, IPO spreads are
6 Seven of the moderate size IPOs in the 1995 to 1997 period that deviated from the seven
percent norm were equity carveouts from Thermo Electron at spreads of 6.5 percent, six of
which were underwritten by Natwest Securities. An equity carveout is an IPO that is a subsidiary of a parent company, where the parent company retains a partial equity stake. In a
telephone conversation on June 11, 1998 with Thanasis Delistathis, who is currently in charge
of handling these equity carveouts for Thermo Electron, an explanation was offered. First,
Thermo Electron has done many equity carveouts over the years, and its in-house experience
speeds up the paperwork, lowering costs for investment bankers. Second, Thermo Electron
began doing equity carveouts before seven percent become established as an industry norm.
The company successfully argues that each new deal should be done at the same spread as the
previous deals, and the underwriters view these offerings as a special case. Allen (1998) examines the equity carveouts of Thermo Electron from 1983 to 1995.
7 In 1998, the British
government's Monopolies and Mergers Commission launched an inquiry into possible price-fixing on equity offerings in the U.K. (see The Economist, June 27,
1998). The focus of the British inquiry appears to be on the standard two percent fee that is

typically in the range of 3 to 3.5 percent of proceeds for moderate size deals.
In Taiwan, spreads are even lower, although potential buyers of IPOs also
pay a commission, unlike in the United States. Woo (1999) reports that in
Australia the average gross spread (including underwriter and broker fees)
on 68 IPOs with proceeds of $30 to 100 million (Australian) from 1984 to
1996 was 3.4 percent, with considerable cross-sectional variation.
There are certainly differences in the regulations and associated costs for
underwriting IPOs in different countries. One reason frequently advanced to
explain the higher costs of underwriting in the United States is the lawsuit
potential. But the reality is that auditing firms and investment bankers
have been successful in their strategy during the 1980s of fighting securities
fraud lawsuits with such ferocity that plaintiffs attorneys usually do not
even bother suing them anymore (see Beatty and Welch (1996)). Instead,
directors and officers (D&O) insurance pays settlements in the typical securities class action lawsuit, with underwriters untouched.
D. Spreads on Small and Large IPOs
For deals below $20 million, spreads are frequently even higher than seven
percent, as shown in Figure 3. This is consistent with substantial fixed costs
in underwriting. Revenue must be sufficient to cover the cost of writing a
charged for "sub-underwriting" seasoned equity offerings. In the U.K., seasoned equity offerings are typically rights offerings priced at a discount of about 10 percent to the market price,
with the price set several weeks before the exercise date. The sub-underwriting fee is the price
of the put option that the issuer has implicitly purchased. Plausible estimates of the put's value
are substantially less than two percent.

deals and the costs of prospecting for business. The conventional wisdom is
that the large, prestigious investment banking houses have costs that are so
high that they do not find it profitable to do these small deals, which are
primarily sold to a retail, rather than an institutional, clientele. These small
deals frequently include compensation for the underwriters that includes
warrants to buy stock in the issuing company, in addition to the stated gross
spread (Barry et al. (1991)). We do not analyze these small deals.

For large deals, which we define (POs

more, average spreads are below seven percent, and there is little clustering.
Inspection of Figure 2 shows that economies of scale are clearly displayed for
large tPOs: the bigger the deal, the lower the spread tends to be.

E. Spreads on Seasoned Equity Offerings
Given the clustering of IPO spreads, a natural question is whether the
same pattern is observed for the spreads on seasoned equity offerings (SEOs).
Figures 4 and 5 show the spreads on SEOs, also known as follow-on offer-

spreads versus the natural logarithm of proceeds. Figure 5 for SEOs is analogous to Figure 3 for iPOs, showing spreads versus proceeds on deals below
$100 million. Inspection of Figures 4 and 5 shows that there is a slight

tendency to prefer spreads that are at integers or half-integers (4.5 percent,
5.0 percent, 5.5 percent, etc.). Figure 4 suggests that there are economies of
scale in conducting SEOs, with a nearly linear relation between the log of
proceeds and spreads.8 Most important, there is no tendency to cluster on a
single number for SEOs. For SEOs of a given size, there is considerable
dispersion in the spreads paid on different deals. A comparison of the figures
for IPOs and SEOs suggests that there is something special about seven
percent spreads when it comes to IPOs.
F Summary
In sum, the facts show that there is a pronounced clustering of gross spreads
at exactly seven percent for almost all IPOs raising $20 to $80 million. This
concentration increased gradually during the 1988 to 1994 period, to the
point where in recent years well over 90 percent of moderate size IPOs in the
United States have had seven percent spreads. In other countries, spreads
are substantially lower than in the United States. The patterns suggest that
gross spreads are competitive for deals below $20 to $30 million, but increasingly profitable on larger deals. There is no clustering on a single number for SEOs.
8 Altinkilic and Hansen (2000) argue that displays such as Figure 4 tend to overstate the
economies of scale that exist due to a confounding effect. They argue that the larger offerings
are typically from larger, safer firms, and that any given firm faces diseconomies of scale for
proceeds above some amount.

The Journal of Finance
II. Explanations

for High Spreads

At its most general level, this paper is asking the following question: What
features of the IPO market structure are conducive to an equilibrium in
which fees are high?
When going public, an issuing firm typically conducts a "beauty contest"
to choose a lead manager (also known as the book manager) and one or two
co-managers. The conventional wisdom is that underwriter prestige and analyst reputation are of paramount importance in this decision. Underwriters
do not commit to a specific offer price at the time an underwriting agreement is signed. Thus, competition on the basis of valuations is muted.
A. Analyst Coverage
An implicit understanding is that the managing underwriters of an IPO
will each assign a securities analyst to cover the company and produce research reports and issue buy recommendations for the stock (see Power (1993),
Rajan and Servaes (1997), Dunbar (2000), and Michaely and Womack (1999)).
For a small firm (in 1998 a firm with a market capitalization of equity of
$250 million is too small to be included in the Russell 2000), there is a
presumption that the stock price is affected by analyst coverage and whether
there are buy recommendations on the stock. "Buy" recommendations may
be especially important after the lock-up provision has expired, and insiders
want to sell some of their stock in the open market.9 In other words, the
objective function of a firm's managers at the time of the offering includes
raising money at the time of the offering, and raising money in future openmarket insider sales. Other shareholders benefit, too, from the enhanced
liquidity of their shares that is a consequence of the analyst coverage.
In the 1980s, many IPOs did not have co-managers. Today, almost all IPOs
have one, two, three, or even more co-managers. A reason for this growth in
the number of co-managers is that the issuing firm is essentially buying
additional analyst coverage at no incremental expense (since the underwriting fees will be seven percent of proceeds whether or not there are comanagers). In Table III, we report the number of managers for moderate
size (Panel A) and large (Panel B) IPOs. Panel A shows that in the 1985 to
1987 period, 37 percent of moderate size IPOs were solely managed, whereas
in the 1995 to 1998 period, only four percent were.
In Table IV, we report the number of analyst forecasts within one year of
an IPO as reported by I/B/E/S (Institutional Brokers Estimate System).
Our IPO sample ends in 1997 because of this requirement. In Panel C, we
report two regressions where the number of analysts making an earnings
forecast within a year of the IPO is the dependent variable. The top row
reports the results of a pooled cross section-time series regression. The bottom
9 While it is in effect, a lockup provision restricts pre-issue shareholders from selling shares
without the explicit written permission of the managing underwriter. A typical lockup provision
is for 180 calendar days after the IPO.

Analyst Following by Offering Size, Years, and Number of Managers
in the Underwriting
Syndicate and Regression Analysis, 1985-1997
The sample consists of 2,911 firm commitment IPOs in 1985 to 1997 with proceeds of at least
$20 million before the exercise of the overallotment option and covered by I/B/E/S. Closed-end
funds, REITs, ADRs, and unit offerings are excluded from the sample. The amount of proceeds
is expressed in terms of 1997 dollars, using the U.S. GDP price deflator. IPOs with proceeds of
at least $20 million but less than $80 million are designated as moderate size IPOs, others are
designated as large IPOs. Panels A and B report the summary statistics of analyst following.
Number of full coverage represents the number of IPOs in which all managers issue earnings
forecasts within one year after the offering. The first row in Panel C reports the results of a
pooled cross-sectional and time-series regression analysis. The amount of proceeds is measured
in millions of dollars. The sample size is reduced because of the requirement of a first-day
return that is defined as the percentage return from the offering price to the closing price of the
first trading day. Numbers in parentheses are t-statistics calculated using White (1980) robust
standard errors. The second row reports average parameter values from yearly cross-sectional
regressions using the approach of Fama and MacBeth (1973).

row reports the average coefficients from thirteen regressions, each of which
uses the IPOs from one calendar year during 1985 to 1997. The R2 reported
for this second regression is the average of the thirteen R2 values, and the
t-statistics are based on the time-series standard deviation of the coefficients. Both regressions find that more analysts follow an IPO if it is larger,
and if it has a higher first-day return. These results are consistent with
Rajan and Servaes (1997, Table II). Of particular interest, however, is our
finding that an incremental co-manager adds 0.36-0.55 net analysts, holding the proceeds and first-day return constant.
Securities analysts are beneficiaries of this system. Analysts with good
reputations (as measured, e.g., by the annual Institutional Investor magazine all-star rankings) can command a high salary and bonuses. Analysts
who help bring in equity financing business also stand to receive large bonuses (Siconolfi (1992), Smith (1996), and Raghavan (1997)). Krigman, Shaw,
and Womack (1999) report survey evidence that issuers cite analyst coverage as a main determinant for choosing underwriters.
The importance of analyst coverage represents a potential barrier to entry
for new underwriters. Without a well-regarded analyst being involved in the
deal, issuers will be skeptical about the ability of an underwriter to successfully maintain demand for the stock in the aftermarket, or even to place it
initially. Furthermore, by emphasizing industry expertise, the IPO underwriting business becomes one of differentiated products, reducing the number of viable competitors for any given deal.
B. Underwriter Prestige
Underwriter prestige is a second important criterion for choosing managers. There is a perception that the "certification" of a prestigious underwriter is very valuable to an issuing firm. The most prestigious underwriters
today include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Merrill Lynch.
As long as issuing firms choose a lead underwriter primarily on the basis of
analyst and investment banker reputations, there is little incentive for underwriters to charge differential gross spreads, for the elasticity of demand

1120

The Journal of Finance

is not high with respect to the fees charged. Competition to be a lead manager is thus focused on the intermediary's "quality" rather than the fees
charged.
For intermediaries to have an incentive to certify the value of the item
being sold, a stream of future quasi-rents must be anticipated (Beatty and
Ritter (1986), Booth and Smith (1986)). Quasi-rents are the cash flows above
marginal cost that can be viewed as a return on the prior investment in
establishing
a reputation. This framework would suggest that abovecompetitive spreads are needed to give underwriters an incentive to turn
down deals that may be attractive in the short-run, but would be bad for
investors in the long run.
Although above-competitive underwriter compensation is needed to induce
investment bankers to perform a certification function, it is not clear why
this should result in spreads of seven percent for essentially all deals, whether
they are $20 million or $80 million. Given the economies of scale that exist
in the cost structure, the seven percent pricing structure results in substantial profits on deals at the high end of the moderate size range.
C. Underwriting Syndicates
Once an issuer chooses a book manager and co-managers, the lead manager invites other underwriters into the underwriting syndicate. Typically,
the syndicate is split into several brackets (see Carter, Dark, and Singh
(1998) for a description), depending on how many syndicate members there
are. Because the fees are shared among the syndicate members, at first
glance the resulting revenue sharing might be viewed as conducive to a
reduced competitive environment.
Historically, syndicates existed partly for regulatory capital requirement
and risk-sharing purposes, and partly to facilitate the distribution of an
issue. This was particularly relevant when the lead underwriter did not
have a significant retail or institutional distribution network, and had limited capital. Today, there is little reason to form a syndicate to perform the
traditional economic roles of risk sharing, distribution, and meeting capital
requirements. Not surprisingly, syndicate size, as measured by the number
of participating firms, has fallen over time, even as the number of comanagers has grown. Underwriters such as Merrill Lynch, with their large
institutional and retail distribution networks, do not need other investment
bankers to assist in distributing a given issue. Arndwith their large capital
bases, risk sharing would seem to be important only for the very largest
issues.
In recent years almost all IPOs have had not only a book manager, but
also one or two co-managers. In Table V, we present a hypothetical example
with Goldman Sachs as lead underwriter and BT Alex. Brown as the comanager. We assume that there are 13 other members of the underwriting
syndicate, where the two managers underwrite 900,000 shares each, the
seven members of the major bracket underwrite 100,000 shares each, and

The Seven Percent Solution

1121

the six members of the submajor bracket underwrite 50,000 shares each.
The total number of shares is 2,800,000, before a 15 percent overallotment
option, and the amount of gross proceeds at the $12.00 offer price is
$33,600,000 net of the overallotment option. We assume a gross spread of
seven percent, which has three components, as shown in Panel A of Table V.
Of the 84 cent gross spread, we assume a selling concession of 48 cents, an
underwriting fee of 19 cents, and a management fee of 17 cents. A syndicate
member would receive 48 cents for each share whose sale is credited to that
member. There is no necessary relation between the number of shares underwritten and the selling credits earned. Normally, the vast majority of the
shares sold will be credited to the book manager, as illustrated in Panel B of
Table V. All 15 syndicate members would receive the underwriting fee of
19 cents, minus underwriting and stabilization expenses, for each share underwritten. The managing underwriters would receive 17 cents on every
share sold by any member, with the split between the lead and co-managing
underwriters usually tilted in the lead manager's favor.
In a typical IPO, the vast majority of revenue and profits goes to the book
manager, as illustrated in Panel C of Table V. The book manager receives at
least a proportionate share of the management fee revenue, the vast majority of the selling concession revenue, and part of the net underwriting fee
revenue. This last item is typically a small number, and may even be negative if stabilization expenses are high.
There are certain ongoing expenses that lead and co-managers have, such
as the pay of analysts and corporate finance employees, so the revenue figures
are not the same as profit figures. Furthermore, part of the revenue is merely
a competitive return on the capital required by regulators to underwrite
securities. But the example in Table V shows how lucrative it can be to be the
lead manager on a large IPO. Thus, although the fees are shared among syndicate members, there is still fierce competition to be a lead manager.
It is noteworthy that new entrants to the IPO underwriting market have
not tried to gain market share by cutting spreads. The two most prominent
new entrants in IPO underwriting in the 1990s have been Deutsche Bank
Securities (formerly Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG)) and Friedman Billings Ramsey. Both firms have charged seven percent spreads on moderate
size IPOs in the mid-1990s.
D. The Cost of Price Support
Underwriters frequently stabilize, or support, the price of an IPO immediately after it has gone public. Price support involves the practice of being a net
buyer of shares, which are retired if the underwriter overallocates the issue.
If an underwriter buys back too many shares in an attempt to keep the market
price from dipping below the offer price, it will not be able to exercise the overallotment option. This would result in less profit for the underwriter. The probability that the overallotment option will be exercised increases when there is
higher expected underpricing. If spreads were lower, underwriters might be

tempted to set lower offer prices in order to reduce the chance of not exercising
the overallotment option. The indirect cost of this underpricing might be far
larger than the savings in direct costs on the spreads.
A desire by issuers to reduce the amount of money left on the table by
paying high spreads is plausible. This does not explain, however, why there
should be clustering at seven percent. Furthermore, an issuer who wants to
increase incentives for stabilization could insist on a change in the components of the gross spread, reducing the selling concession and/or management fee, and increasing the underwriting fee. In any case, Aggarwal (2000)
reports that empirically the costs of stabilization to underwriters are relatively small.

E. Spreads Signal High Quality Underwriting
In many other markets, such as medical specialties, consulting, and
legal advice, professionals find that charging a low price for their services signals lower quality and results in lost business. This phenomenon
is present in markets where clients are unable to easily evaluate quality
on either an ex ante or ex post basis, and where repeat dealings are
uncommon. In these markets, sellers of services tend to charge high
prices and at least some market participants have excess capacity (which
they attempt to hide because its existence might signal low quality). An
underwriter charging a low fee might raise concerns about its willingness to engage in price stabilization, provide analyst coverage, exercise
care in helping to write a prospectus, aggressively market a deal, and so
forth.
IPO underwriting seems to share many of the characteristics of markets
where price signals quality. But while any given firm will generally go public just once, limiting repeat business and learning, this is too myopic a view.
Reputation effects overcome some of the information asymmetries: If Goldman Sachs decided to cut its spreads, few issuers would conjecture that it
had become a low-quality underwriter.

III. Explanations

for the Clustering
at Seven Percent

of Spreads

A. Explicit Collusion
One possible explanation for the clustering of spreads at seven percent
is collusion. If underwriters compete for business on the basis of spreads
that they charge, competition will drive the spread on any given deal to
the cost of providing the services, including compensation for expected risks
that are borne by the underwriter. If underwriters agree to form a cartel,
they can increase their profits. On every deal, a mechanism to decide how
much to charge would be needed. One possible arrangement is to agree
to always charge the same fees (seven percent), with the profits shared.
The existence of syndicates would seem to be an excellent way to share the
profits.
With literally scores of people involved in setting spreads at different investment banking firms, the ability to explicitly collude and keep it a secret
strains credibility. Legal liability is also a deterrent.10 And though underwriting syndicates could in principle be used for sharing profits, in practice
the lead underwriter grabs the lion's share of profits.
10 NASD Notice to Members 98-88, issued in October 1998, reminds underwriters that there
is no standard level of underwriter compensation, and that coordination among members on the
gross spreads charged is explicitly prohibited. This notice was partly motivated by the pattern
of clustering at seven percent spreads on IPOs.

The Seven Percent Solution

1125

B. Strategic Pricing
It is possible that investment bankers are of the opinion that if they compete aggressively on the basis of fees, spreads will be driven down to the
point where there will be little money for year-end bonuses for the individuals involved. Thus, the individuals involved may act strategically to avoid
turning IPO underwriting into a "commodity business." Strategic pricing
requires that each underwriter realizes that high spreads result in large
year-end bonuses that would be jeopardized if spreads get driven down to
competitive levels due to cutthroat competition. As long as the present value
of the future cash flows resulting from high spreads is greater than the
short-term gains associated with undercutting the competition to win a deal,
each underwriter will avoid cutting its spread.
The logic behind the strategic pricing explanation for high spreads can
be formalized in a noncooperative dynamic game (Chen (1998)), based on
the Dutta and Madhavan (1997) model. With IPOs, it is quite plausible that underwriters fear that quoting a lower spread will set off a price
war that will drive gross spreads down on future deals. After all, many of
the individuals in the business that we have talked to state that they do
not want to charge a lower spread because they "don't want to turn it into
a commodity business." It is hard to think of stronger evidence to support
the proposition that the participants are thinking strategically. In other
words, they are forecasting the spreads that will prevail in the future based
on what is done today, and acting accordingly. Thus, each underwriter may
decide to keep its spread above competitive levels, even without explicit
collusion.
The strategic pricing argument also offers an explanation for why the
spreads on deals above $80 million are generally lower than seven percent.
Since there are economies of scale in the costs of underwriting IPOs, deals
above $30 or $40 million are for the most part extremely profitable at a
seven percent spread. If the profits on a deal are too large, each underwriter
has an incentive to undercut the competition, even if it means jeopardizing
all of the future profits from high spreads. In order to forestall a price war
from breaking out, underwriters must limit the economic profits earned on
any given deal to a "reasonable" level (see Rotemberg and Saloner (1986),
Dutta and Madhavan (1997), and Chen (1998)). Beyond a certain level of
proceeds size, spreads of seven percent are unsustainable.
The strategic pricing explanation for high average fees and clustering at
seven percent raises the following question: Why, since sellers in every industry prefer high prices to low prices, is a strategic pricing equilibrium
sustainable with IPO spreads and not in most other businesses? Our answer
is that customers (issuing firms) view the fees charged as just one of a set of
characteristics on which to choose an underwriter. Krigman et al.'s (1999)
survey of issuing firms supports this view. If customers were more focused
on fees, the strategic pricing equilibrium would be harder to sustain relative
to the competitive ("commodity business") equilibrium.

C. Resolving Agency Costs with Multiple Principals
There are many other markets for intermediary services which display
strong clustering of fees at integers. Probably the most obvious example is
brokerage commissions on residential real estate; in many cities, most transactions are done at 6.0 percent. The real estate market involves both listing
agents (representing sellers) and buying agents. Each property has a vector
of characteristics and different buyers have different tastes, resulting in a
time-intensive matching problem. In real estate, agents representing buyers
observe the fees being offered on a property through the multiple listing
service books, and they steer clients away from properties that do not compensate the agents well. Because real estate agents are representing multiple clients, charging a uniform commission eliminates the incentive of agents
to spend a disproportionately low amount of effort on properties offering
lower commissions (Williams (1998)). Also, there is less homogeneity of real
estate percentage fees than it appears. In fact, real estate fees can be negotiated in two ways. First, on properties that ex ante appear easy to sell, a
seller can get a listing agent to rebate part of the listing fee. Second, when
a buyer makes a bid on a property, the seller can respond with a reservation
price (net of commission) where the difference is too small to give the brokers their full commission. Rather than start all over with a new buyer or a
new house, the agents can be ex post "squeezed." In other words, there is a
hold-up problem.
There are several important distinctions between the markets for intermediaries in real estate and for IPOs. With financial securities, the objective
function of both buyers and sellers is dependent primarily on a single attribute,
the cash payoffs. So, unlike in real estate, there is not a time-intensive problem of matching desired characteristics. Thus, a uniform commission so that
one client is not favored over another client is not needed with IPOs.

D. Other Components of Compensation
If underwriter compensation is composed of more than just the spread, the
clustering of spreads at seven percent may give a misleading view of the
degree of clustering of the total compensation. On small offerings, underwriter warrants, "nonaccountable expense allowances," and other additional
underwriter compensation is common. But for deals above $20 million, industry practice is to have the gross spread represent all of the underwriter's
compensation. Inspection of a random sample of prospectuses in 1997 for
IPOs with proceeds of $20 to $25 million found no cases of nonaccountable
expense allowances boosting underwriter compensation. It should also be
noted that almost all IPOs have a 15 percent overallotment option, so there
is almost no time-series or cross-sectional variation on this dimension.
One dimension on which there is substantial cross-sectional variation, however, is the degree of short-run underpricing. On average, the first-day return on IPOs is 10 to 15 percent (e.g., see Lee et al. (1996, Table 4)), which is

The Seven Percent Solution

1127

an indirect cost of going public. The first-day returns represent profits to
investors (and an opportunity cost to issuers) that are approximately twice
as large as the direct fees received by underwriters. For example, on a $40
million IPO with a seven percent spread and a first-day return of 14 percent,
the direct fees are $2.8 million, and the money "left on the table" is $5.6
million. In this example, investment bankers have $5.6 million in profits to
hand out to favored clients, such as clients who are willing to overpay for
other services. In unreported regressions, we have examined whether there
is a trade-off between underpricing and spreads. The evidence of a trade-off
existing is fairly weak.
Another form of compensation for the lead underwriter is the profits from
future market making activity. Ellis, Michaely, and O'Hara (2000) report
that the lead underwriter usually is the most active market maker in the
first 60 days of post-IPO trading for a sample of 312 Nasdaq-listed IPOs
from 1996 to 1997. They calculate that the lead underwriter makes money
on this market making activity, although the numbers are modest relative to
the fees from the gross spread.
There is no regulatory constraint that forces spreads to equal seven
percent. National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) Rule 2710
prohibits a member from participating in a public offering with unfair
or unreasonable underwriter compensation, where NASD Regulation's
Corporate Financing Department has direct responsibility for the review
of underwriter compensation.
There is no evidence that this rule is
a binding constraint for the moderate size and large deals that we
analyze.
E. Resale Price Maintenance
As discussed in Section II, the conventional wisdom is that future analyst
coverage is an important consideration for firms going public. Thus, investment bankers are intermediaries who are selling a bundle of services: the
IPO underwriting itself, and future analyst coverage. By paying abovecompetitive underwriting fees, issuing companies induce underwriters to offer more analyst coverage in their attempt to compete for the profitable
business. The logic is the same as that of the "resale price maintenance"
literature, where a producer wants distributors to offer a minimum service
level (Telser (1960)). By setting a minimum price at which the products can
be resold, the producer induces the intermediaries to offer more services
than they otherwise would.
Although high spreads on average can be viewed as compensation for inducing underwriters to provide future analyst coverage, this does not explain why seven percent spreads on $80 million deals are the norm, just as
they are on $20 million deals. The clustering at seven percent for almost all
deals within a very large range of proceeds suggests that the larger and
safer deals are providing substantial economic profits to the underwriters
involved.

The Journal of Finance

1128

Presumably, some issuers would prefer to pay high fees and "purchase" a
high level of services. Other issuers would prefer fewer services in return for
lower fees. But the lack of dispersion of spreads suggests that this choice is
not available to issuers.
F Cross-Subsidization
One possible reason for the clustering of spreads at seven percent is that
underwriters have difficulty knowing their exact costs on a given deal, and
they price their services in a manner whereby some issuers subsidize other
issuers. As long as underwriters break even on average, there is little reason
to change this policy. The problem with this argument is that, given the
economies of scale that exist, it does not take a rocket scientist to realize
that $80 million deals are more profitable than $20 million deals if the percentage spread is the same on both. An underwriter could increase its profitability by concentrating on the larger deals.
IV. Possible

Reasons for the Increased
of Spreads over Time

Clustering

As shown in Table I and Figure 1, the clustering of spreads has increased
substantially in the last decade. This raises the question of why this is so.
One possibility is that, as in almost all markets, learning has occurred
over time. In the mid and late 1970s, IPO volume in the United States (and
almost all other countries) was virtually nonexistent, with the number of
deals per year less than the number in many weeks during the 1990s. As IPO
volume picked up in the 1980s, four boutiques (L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg,
Towbin; Robertson Stephens; Hambrecht & Quist; and Alex. Brown) specializing in IPO underwriting captured a large share of a growing market. In
the early 1980s, "bulge bracket" investment bankers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch did relatively few IPOs. By the mid1980s, the bulge bracket firms started to get more involved, and L.F. Rothschild
went out of business after a falloff in IPO volume following the 1987 market
crash.
In the 1980s, there was more heterogeneity of spreads, less concentration
of underwriters, and a higher frequency of sole managers. The average spread
on IPOs has not changed, even as clustering has increased, but this is not
evidence that spreads are at competitive levels today. In many related markets, such as the fees on mergers and acquisitions, investment banker fees
have fallen from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Auditor fees have declined,
too. The fact that IPO spreads have not fallen is consistent with the existence of a market structure that is conducive to strategic pricing.
Several other reasons may explain the increased clustering over time. First,
precedent is important. It is easier to justify a given spread to a client if an
underwriter can point to other recent deals at the same (or a higher) spread.
Charging a higher than seven percent spread might have become increasingly

The Seven Percent Solution

1129

unattractive as competitors used it to dissuade a potential client from going
with an expensive underwriter. Also, in the 1980s it may have been more
common to negotiate the spread at the pricing meeting immediately before
an offering, at the same time that the offering price and number of shares to
be issued are negotiated. (See Uttal (1986) for a description of the negotiation of the spread in the Microsoft IPO.)
V. Summary

and Conclusions

This article presents evidence of the clustering of gross spreads on IPOs at
seven percent, with the concentration of seven percent spreads increasing
during the 1990s. For offerings with proceeds of $20 to 80 million (in dollars
of 1997 purchasing power), more than 90 percent of IPOs during the 1995 to
1998 period had spreads of exactly seven percent. For comparison, only 26
percent of moderate size IPOs in the 1985 to 1987 period had seven percent
spreads. There is widespread agreement that fixed costs exist in underwriting IPOs, yet investment bankers charge the same seven percent spread on
$20 million deals as they do on $80 million deals. The average spread on
IPOs has remained virtually constant during the 1985 to 1998 period, in
contrast to declining fees for mergers and acquisitions, etc. Spreads on U.S.
IPOs are roughly twice as high as in other countries.
We argue that for most IPOs with gross proceeds larger than $30 million,
spreads are above competitive levels in the United States. The high average
spread and the concentration of spreads at seven percent is consistent with
strategic pricing on the part of investment bankers. In other words, even
though investment bankers are acting independently, average spreads are
above competitive levels. We argue that several features of the IPO underwriting market are conducive to spreads above competitive levels. The importance of analyst coverage and buy recommendations, and the perceived
importance of underwriter prestige, facilitate high spreads.
If gross spreads are above competitive levels, investment bankers have an
incentive to use nonprice competition to attract deals. Although issuing firms
face high and, for moderate size deals, nonnegotiable spreads, issuers can
still bargain on another dimension. In particular, by insisting on additional
co-managers, issuing firms receive more extensive analyst coverage. We show
that the number of co-managers has increased over the last decade, and that
an additional co-manager adds between 0.36 and 0.55 net analysts following
the stock. Highly ranked analysts have benefited, as their compensation has
been bid up as underwriters use the implicit promise of favorable coverage
and buy recommendations to compete for business. Investment bankers are
also able to use analyst coverage as a means for product differentiation,
relaxing price competition.
There is a further aspect to industry specialization by analysts that is
relevant. To the degree that the only underwriters that would be viable competitors are those with a well-regarded analyst, an investment banker that
undercuts spreads on IPOs in one industry cannot expect to gain market

1130

The Journal of Finance

share in IPOs from other industries. To the degree that the broader market
is split into submarkets, the gains from undercutting the spread for an underwriter are limited to the submarket, increasing the sustainable spread
(see Dutta and Madhavan (1997)). In this respect, industry specialization by
investment bankers is analogous to payment for order flow on Nasdaq stocks.
We favor a strategic pricing explanation for the patterns that we have
documented. The evidence is consistent with underwriters realizing that if
one investment banker tries to win business by cutting spreads, the underwriting industry is likely to move to an equilibrium with low spreads, and
lower compensation for corporate finance employees.
In contrast to the pattern for IPOs, there is little clustering of spreads on
follow-on offerings, and economies of scale are evident for all proceeds sizes.
The difference in findings for IPOs and SEOs suggests that investment bankers and analysts are more important in establishing a public market than in
sustaining one.
There is some evidence that gross spreads on follow-on offerings have come
down a little in recent years (see Beatty, Thompson, and Vetsuypens (1998)
and Gande, Puri, and Saunders (1999)). Trade journals have attributed this
to competition from commercial banks, which are trying to enter the underwriting business. It remains to be seen how big an impact this is having on
the gross spreads on follow-on offerings, and whether this competition has
any effect on the gross spreads on IPOs. In the year after Nationsbank,
Bankers Trust, BankAmerica, and BancBoston bought investment banking
firms that specialized in IPOs, there does not seem to have been any impact
in the IPO market. Another source of competition may emerge from the
innovation of internet technology. For example, new underwriters W.R. Hambrecht and E*Offering threaten to undercut the seven percent fee that is
now standard. Only time will tell whether this changes the gross spreads
that prevail in the IPO underwriting industry.
