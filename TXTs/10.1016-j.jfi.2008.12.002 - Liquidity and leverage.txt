In a ﬁnancial system in which balance sheets are continuously
marked to market, asset price changes appear immediately as
changes in net worth, and eliciting responses from ﬁnancial intermediaries who adjust the size of their balance sheets. We document evidence that marked-to-market leverage is strongly
procyclical. Such behavior has aggregate consequences. Changes
in dealer repos – the primary margin of adjustment for the aggregate balance sheets of intermediaries – forecast changes in ﬁnancial market risk as measured by the innovations in the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index VIX index. Aggregate
liquidity can be seen as the rate of change of the aggregate balance
sheet of the ﬁnancial intermediaries.

1. Introduction
In a ﬁnancial system where balance sheets are continuously marked to market, changes in asset
prices show up immediately on balance sheets, and have an instant impact on the net worth of all constituents of the ﬁnancial system. The net worth of ﬁnancial intermediaries are especially sensitive to
ﬂuctuations in asset prices given the highly leveraged nature of such intermediaries’ balance sheets.
Our focus in this paper is on the reactions of the ﬁnancial intermediaries to changes in their net
worth, and the market-wide consequences of such reactions. If ﬁnancial intermediaries were passive

and did not adjust their balance sheets to changes in net worth, then leverage would fall when total
assets rise. Change in leverage and change in balance sheet size would then be negatively related.
However, as we will see below, the evidence points to a strongly positive relationship between
changes in leverage and changes in balance sheet size. Far from being passive, the evidence points
to ﬁnancial intermediaries adjusting their balance sheets actively, and doing so in such a way that
leverage is high during booms and low during busts. That is, leverage is procyclical.
Procyclical leverage can be seen as a consequence of the active management of balance sheets by
ﬁnancial intermediaries who respond to changes in prices and measured risk. For ﬁnancial intermediaries, their models of risk and economic capital dictate active management of their overall Value-atRisk (VaR) through adjustments of their balance sheets.
From the point of view of each institution, decision rules that result in procyclical leverage are
readily understandable. However, there are aggregate consequences of such behavior for the ﬁnancial
system as a whole that might not be taken into consideration by individual institutions. We exhibit
evidence that procyclical leverage affects aggregate volatility and particularly the price of risk.
Our paper has two main objectives. Our ﬁrst objective is to document the relationship between balance sheet size and leverage for security broker dealers – ﬁnancial intermediaries that operate primarily through the capital markets, and which included the major Wall Street investment banks. We show
that leverage is strongly procyclical for these institutions and show that the margin of adjustment on
the balance sheet is through repos and reverse repos. The ﬁrst version of our paper was written in June
2007, just prior to the eruption of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2009. Since then, the ﬁve major US
investments banks that we analyze in the remainder of the paper have all left the broker dealer sector.
Three of them – Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch were either taken over under distressed conditions or declared bankruptcy. The remaining two – Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
– converted to bank holding companies. Thus, in the short time period since the ﬁrst version of this
paper was written, the era of stand alone Wall Street investment banks has come to an end. Our paper
represents a contemporaneous record of the last months of the once illustrious Wall Street investment
banks.
Our second objective is to pursue the aggregate consequences of procyclical leverage and document evidence that expansions and contractions of balance sheets have asset pricing consequences
through shifts in risk appetite. In particular, we show that changes in collateralized borrowing and
lending on intermediary’s balance sheet are signiﬁcant forecasting variables for innovations in market-wide risk as measured by the VIX index of implied volatility in the stock market. We also decompose VIX innovations into changes of stock market volatility and changes of the difference between
implied volatility and actual volatility (the volatility risk premium). We ﬁnd that dealer balance sheet
changes primarily forecast changes in the volatility risk premium, which has a natural interpretation
as the price of risk.
Previous work has shown that innovations in market volatility are important cross-sectional pricing factors (see Ang et al. (2006), and Adrian and Rosenberg (2008)), and that the volatility risk premium forecasts future equity returns (Bollerslev and Zhou (2007)). Our ﬁnding that ﬂuctuations of the
balance sheets of broker dealers forecast volatility innovations shows that intermediary balance
sheets matter for the pricing of risk. In this way, our empirical results provide some backing to recent
theoretical work on liquidity and asset pricing. Gromb and Vayanos (2002) draw on the theme in Shleifer and Vishny (1997) on the importance of collateral constraints for leveraged traders. Brunnermeier
and Pedersen (2009) coined the term ‘‘margin spiral” where increased margins and falling prices reinforce market distress. He and Krishnamurthy (2008) show how intermediary capital matters in a dynamic asset pricing model. Our empirical results provide some context for this literature.
Our ﬁndings also shed light on the concept of ‘‘liquidity” as used in common discourse about ﬁnancial market conditions. In the ﬁnancial press and other market commentary, asset price booms are
sometimes attributed to ‘‘excess liquidity” in the ﬁnancial system. Financial commentators are fond
of using the associated metaphors, such as the ﬁnancial markets being ‘‘awash with liquidity”, or
liquidity ‘‘sloshing around”. However, the precise sense in which ‘‘liquidity” is being used in such contexts is often left unspeciﬁed.
Our empirical ﬁndings suggest that ﬁnancial market liquidity can be understood as the rate of
growth of aggregate balance sheets. In response to increases in prices on the asset side of intermedi-

420

aries’ balance sheets, leverage falls, and intermediaries hold surplus capital. They will then search for
uses of their surplus capital. In a loose analogy with manufacturing ﬁrms, we may see the ﬁnancial
system as having ‘‘surplus capacity”. For such surplus capacity to be utilized, the intermediaries expand their balance sheets. On the liabilities side, they take on more short-term debt. On the asset side,
they search for potential borrowers that they can lend to. Financial market liquidity is intimately tied
to how hard the ﬁnancial intermediaries search for borrowers.
The outline of our paper is as follows: we begin with a review of some very basic balance sheet
arithmetic on the relationship between leverage and total assets. The purpose of this initial exercise
is to motivate our empirical investigation of the balance sheet changes of ﬁnancial intermediaries
in Section 3. Having outlined the facts, in Section 4, we show that changes in aggregate repo positions
of the major ﬁnancial intermediaries can forecast innovations in the volatility risk-premium, where
the volatility risk premium is deﬁned as the difference between the VIX index and realized volatility.
We conclude with discussions of the implications of our ﬁndings for funding liquidity.
2. Some basic balance sheet arithmetic
What is the relationship between leverage and balance sheet size? We begin with some very elementary balance sheet arithmetic, so as to focus ideas. Before looking at the evidence for ﬁnancial
intermediaries, let us think about the relationship between balance sheet size and leverage for a
household. The household owns a house ﬁnanced with a mortgage. For concreteness, suppose the
house is worth 100, the mortgage value is 90, and so the household has net worth (equity) of 10.
The initial balance sheet then is given by:

Leverage is deﬁned as the ratio of total assets to equity, hence is 100=10 ¼ 10. What happens to
leverage as total assets ﬂuctuate? Denote by A the market value of total assets and E is the market value of equity. We make the simplifying assumption that the market value of debt stays roughly constant at 90 for small shifts in the value of total assets. Total leverage is then

L’

A
A  90

Leverage is inversely related to total assets. When the price of my house goes up, my net worth increases, and so my leverage goes down. Indeed, for households, the negative relationship between total assets and leverage is clearly borne out in the aggregate data. Fig. 1 plots the quarterly changes in
total assets to quarterly changes in leverage as given in the Flow of Funds account for the United
States. The data are from 1963 to 2006. The scatter chart shows a strongly negative relationship, as
suggested by a passive behavior toward asset price changes.
We can ask the same question for ﬁrms, and we will address this question for three different types
of ﬁrms: non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms, commercial banks and security brokers and dealers. If a ﬁrm were passive in the face of ﬂuctuating asset prices, then leverage would vary inversely with total assets. However, the evidence points to a more active management of balance sheets.
Fig. 2 is a scatter chart of the change in leverage and change in total assets of non-ﬁnancial, nonfarm corporations drawn from the U.S. ﬂow of funds data (1963–2006). The scatter chart shows much
less of a negative pattern, suggesting that companies react somewhat to changes in asset prices by
shifting their stance on leverage.1 More notable still is the analogous chart for U.S. commercial banks,
again drawn from the U.S. Flow of Funds accounts. Fig. 3 is the scatter chart plotting changes in leverage
1
This ﬁnding is consistent with Welch’s (2004) analysis of non-ﬁnancial leverage which demonstrates that 40% of leverage
changes are (passively) explained by shocks to equity prices, and 60% by the net issuing activity.

against changes in total assets for U.S. commercial banks. A large number of the observations line up
along the vertical line that passes through zero change in leverage. In other words, the data show the
outward signs of commercial banks targeting a ﬁxed leverage ratio.
However, even more striking than the scatter chart for commercial banks is that for security dealers
and brokers, that include the major Wall Street investment banks. Fig. 4 is the scatter chart for U.S.
security dealers and brokers, again drawn from the Flow of Funds accounts (1963–2006). The alignment of the observations is now the reverse of that for households. There is a strongly positive relationship between changes in total assets and changes in leverage. In this sense, leverage is procyclical.
In order to appreciate the aggregate consequences of procyclical leverage, let us ﬁrst consider the
behavior of a ﬁnancial intermediary that manages its balance sheet actively to as to maintain a
constant leverage ratio of 10. The effects we describe below will be even larger for leverage that is

procyclical. Suppose the initial balance sheet is as follows. The ﬁnancial intermediary holds 100 worth
of securities, and has funded this holding with debt worth 90.

Assume that the price of debt is approximately constant for small changes in total assets. Suppose
the price of securities increases by 1% to 101.

T. Adrian, H.S. Shin / J. Finan. Intermediation 19 (2010) 418–437

423

Leverage then falls to 101=11 ¼ 9:18. The bank targets leverage of 10, and so takes on additional
debt of D to purchase D worth of securities on the asset side so that

assets 101 þ D

equity
11
The solution is D ¼ 9. The bank takes on additional debt worth 9, and with this money purchases securities worth 9. Thus, an increase in the price of the security of 1 leads to an increased holding worth 9.
After the purchase, leverage is now back up to 10.

The mechanism works in reverse, too. Suppose there is shock to the securities price so that the value of security holdings falls to 109. On the liabilities side, it is equity that bears the burden of adjustment, since the value of debt stays approximately constant.

Leverage is now too high ð109=10 ¼ 10:9Þ. The bank can adjust down its leverage by selling securities worth 9, and paying down 9 worth of debt. Thus, a fall in the price of securities of leads to sales of
securities. The new balance sheet then looks as follows. The balance sheet is now back to where it
started before the price changes. Leverage is back down to the target level of 10.

The perverse nature of the reactions to price changes are even stronger when the leverage of the
ﬁnancial intermediary is procyclical. When the securities price goes up, the upward adjustment of
leverage entails purchases of securities that are even larger than that for the case of constant leverage.
If there is the possibility of feedback, then the adjustment of leverage and price changes will reinforce
each other in an ampliﬁcation of the ﬁnancial cycle.
If ﬁnancial markets are not perfectly liquid so that greater demand for the asset tends to put upward pressure on its price, then there is the potential for a feedback effect in which stronger balance
sheets feed greater demand for the asset, which in turn raises the asset’s price and lead to stronger
balance sheets. Fig. 5 illustrates the feedback during a boom. The mechanism works exactly in reverse
in downturns. If ﬁnancial markets are not perfectly liquid so that greater supply of the asset tends to
put downward pressure on its price, then there is the potential for a feedback effect in which weaker
balance sheets lead to greater sales of the asset, which depresses the asset’s price and lead to even
weaker balance sheets. Fig. 6 illustrates the feedback during a downturn.

In Section 4, we return to the issue of feedback by exhibiting evidence that is consistent with the
ampliﬁcation effects sketched above. We will see that changes in key balance sheet components forecast changes in the VIX index of implied volatility in the stock market.
3. A ﬁrst look at the evidence
3.1. Investment bank balance sheets
To set the stage for our empirical study, we begin by examining the quarterly changes in the balance sheets of the (then) ﬁve major US investment banks, as listed below in Table 1. The data are from
the regulatory ﬁlings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on their 10-K and 10-Q
forms.
Our choice of these ﬁve banks is motivated by our concern to examine ‘‘pure play” investment
banks that were not part of bank holding companies so as to focus attention on their behavior with

respect to the capital markets.2 Citigroup reported its investment banking operations separately from its
commercial banking operations until 2004 as ‘‘Citigroup Global Markets”, and we have data for the period 1998Q1–2004Q4. In some of our charts below, we will report Citigroup Global Markets for comparison. The stylized balance sheet of an investment bank is as follows.

On the asset side, traded assets are valued at market prices, or are short term collateralized loans
(such as reverse repos) for which the discrepancy between face value and market value are very small
due to the very short term nature of the loans. On the liabilities side, short positions are at market values, and repos are very short term borrowing. We will return to a more detailed descriptions of repos
and reverse repos below. Long-term debt is typically a small fraction of the balance sheet for investment banks.3 For these reasons, investment banks provide a good approximation of the balance sheet
that is continuously marked to market, and hence provide insights into how leverage changes with balance sheet size.
The second reason for our study of investment banks lies in their increasing signiﬁcance for the
ﬁnancial system until the ﬁnancial crisis that led to the demise of the large investment banks.
Fig. 7 plots the size of securities ﬁrms’ balance sheets relative to that of bank holding companies.
We also plot the assets under management for hedge funds, although we should be mindful that

The balance sheet of Lehman Brothers as of November 2005 shows that short positions are around a quarter of total assets, and
long term debt is an even smaller fraction. Shareholder equity is around 4% of total assets (implying leverage of around 25). Shortterm borrowing in terms of repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing takes up the remainder.

‘‘assets under management” refers to total investor equity, rather than the size of the balance sheet. To
obtain total balance sheet size, we should multiply by hedge fund leverage (which is not readily available). Fig. 7 shows that when expressed as a proportion of bank holding company balance sheets, securities ﬁrms had been increasing their balance sheets at a very rapid rate. Note that when hedge funds’
assets under management is converted to balance sheet size by multiplying by a conservative leverage
factor of 2, the combined balance sheets of investment banks and hedge funds overtook the bank holding company balance sheets in 1990, and became more that twice as large by 2007.
Size is not the only issue. When balance sheets are marked to market, the responses to price
changes may entail responses that may be disproportionately large. LTCM’s balance sheet was small
relative to the total ﬁnancial sector, but its impact would have been underestimated if only size
had been taken into account. Similarly, the size of the sub-prime mortgage exposures was small relative to the liabilities of the ﬁnancial system as a whole, but the credit crisis of 2007/2008 demonstrates that its impact can be large. Table 2 gives the summary statistics of the investment banks
over the sample period.
We begin with the key question left hanging from the previous section. What is the relationship
between leverage and total assets? The answer is provided in the scatter charts in Fig. 8. We have included the scatter chart for Citigroup Global Markets (1998Q1–2004Q4) for comparison, although Citigroup does not ﬁgure in the panel regressions reported below. The scatter chart shows the growth in
assets and leverage at a quarterly frequency. In all cases, leverage is large when total assets are large.
Leverage is procyclical.
There are some notable common patterns in the scatter charts, but also some notable differences.
The events of 1998 are clearly evident in the scatter charts. The early part of the year saw strong
growth in total assets, with the attendant increase in leverage. However, the third and fourth quarters
of 1998 shows all the hallmarks of ﬁnancial distress and the attendant retrenchment in the balance
sheet. For most banks, there were very large contractions in balance sheet size in 1998Q4, accompanied by large falls in leverage. These points are on the bottom left hand corners of the respective scatter charts, showing large contractions in the balance sheet and decrease in leverage. Lehman Brothers
and Merrill Lynch seem especially hard hit in 1998Q4.

However, there are also some notable differences. It is notable, for instance, that for Citigroup Global Markets, the large retrenchment seems to have happened in the third quarter of 1998, rather than
in the ﬁnal quarter of 1998. Such a retrenchment would be consistent with the closing down of the
former Salomon Brothers ﬁxed income arbitrage desk on July 6th 1998, following the acquisition of
the operation by Travelers Group (later, Citigroup). Many commentators see this event as the catalyst
for the sequence of events that eventually led to the demise of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)
and the associated ﬁnancial distress in the summer and early autumn of 1998.4
Fig. 9 aggregates the individual scatter charts by taking the asset-weighted average of changes in
balance sheet size and leverage. The upward-sloping relationship between changes in assets and
changes in leverage is clearer. The 45-degree line in the scatter chart corresponds to the combination
of points where the total equity value remains constant. This is because leverage growth is deﬁned as
the log difference in assets minus log difference in equity. Hence, the 45-degree line corresponds to
the points where the log difference in equity is zero. The set of points below the 45-degree line corresponds to the observations in which equity fell. This explains why the observations for the third and
fourth quarters of 2007 appear below the 45-degree line, as banks announced credit losses on their
mortgage portfolios. More interestingly, there is a striking contrast between what happened in
1998 following the LTCM crisis and the credit crisis of 2007/2008. As of the ﬁrst quarter of 2008, there
had not been the same type of contraction of balance sheets as was observed in the 1998 crisis. This
difference holds the key to several distinctive characteristics of the crisis of 2007/2008, as shown by

Table 3 shows the results of a panel regression for change in leverage. The positive relationship between the change in leverage and change in total assets is conﬁrmed in column (ii) of Table 3. The
coefﬁcient on lagged leverage (i.e. previous quarter’s leverage) is negative, suggesting that leverage
is mean-reverting. Leverage is negatively related to lagged Value-at-Risk (ﬁnal column).

The ofﬁcial account (BIS, 1999) is given in the report of the CGFS of the Bank for International Settlements (the so-called
‘‘Johnson Report”). Popular accounts, such as Lowenstein (2000) give a description of the background and personalities.

This table reports panel regressions of quarterly leverage growth rates on the lagged level of leverage, the growth rates of
trading VaRs, the growth rates of repos, and the growth rates of total assets. Leverage is computed from the balance sheets of
the ﬁve investment banks from Table 1 whose summary statistics are reported in Table 2. Leverage is deﬁned as the ratio of
total assets to book equity. All of the balance sheet data are from the 10-K and 10-Q ﬁlings of the banks with the Security and
Exchange Commission. p-values are adjusted for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.

More interestingly, third column of Table 3 shows that the margin of adjustment in the ﬂuctuations
of balance sheets is through repos. In a repurchase agreement (repo), a ﬁnancial institution sells a
security on the understanding that it will buy it back at a pre-agreed price on a ﬁxed future date. Such
an agreement is tantamount to a collateralized loan, with the interest on the loan being the excess of
the repurchase price over the sale price. From the perspective of the funds lender – the party who buys
the security with the undertaking to re-sell it later – such agreements are called reverse repos. For the
buyer, the transaction is equivalent to granting a loan, secured on collateral. In this way, adjustments
in total assets and hence leverage show up as changes in repos, as is visible in Fig. 10.

Fig. 10. Total asset and total repo growth.

Repos and reverse repos are important ﬁnancing activities that provide the funds and securities
needed by investment banks to take positions in ﬁnancial markets. For example, a bank taking a long
position by buying a security needs to deliver funds to the seller when the security is received on settlement day. If the dealer does not fully ﬁnance the security out of its own capital, then it needs to
borrow funds. The purchased security is typically used as collateral for the cash borrowing. When
the bank sells the security, the sale proceeds can be used to repay the lender.
Reverse repos are loans made by the investment bank against collateral. The bank’s prime brokerage business vis-à-vis hedge funds will ﬁgure prominently in the reverse repo numbers. The scatter
chart gives a glimpse into the way in which changes in leverage are achieved through expansions
and contractions in the collateralized borrowing and lending. We saw in our illustrative section on
the elementary balance sheet arithmetic that when a bank wishes to expand its balance sheet, it takes
on additional debt, and with the proceeds of this borrowing takes on more assets. The expansion and
contraction of total assets via repos are plotted in Fig. 11.
Fig. 11 plots the change in assets against change in collateralized borrowing for each of the investment banks. The positive relationship in the scatter plot conﬁrms our panel regression ﬁnding that
balance sheet changes are accompanied by changes in short term borrowing.
Fig. 12 plots the change in repos against the change in reverse repos. A dealer taking a short position by selling a security it does not own needs to deliver the security to the buyer on the settlement
date. This can be done by borrowing the needed security, and providing cash or other securities as collateral. When the dealer closes out the short position by buying the security, the borrowed security
can be returned to the securities lender. The scatter plot in Fig. 12 suggests that repos and reverse repos play such a role as counterparts in the balance sheet.
3.2. Value-at-Risk
Procyclical leverage is not a term that the banks themselves are likely to use in describing what
they do, although this is in fact what they are doing. To get a better handle on what motivates the
banks in their actions, we explore the role of Value-at-Risk (VaR) in explaining the banks’ balance
sheet decisions.
For a random variable A, the Value-at-Risk at conﬁdence level c relative to some base level A0 is deﬁned as the smallest non-negative number VaR such that

For instance, A could be the total marked-to-market assets of the ﬁrm at some given time horizon.
Then the Value-at-Risk is the equity capital that the ﬁrm must hold in order to stay solvent with probability c. Financial intermediaries publish their Value-at-Risk numbers as part of their regulatory ﬁlings and in their annual reports. Their economic capital is tied to the overall Value-at-Risk of the
whole ﬁrm, where the conﬁdence level is set at a level high enough to target a given credit rating (typically A or AA).
If ﬁnancial intermediaries adjust their balance sheets to target a ratio of Value-at-Risk to economic
capital, then we may conjecture that their disclosed Value-at-Risk ﬁgures would be informative in
reconstructing their actions. If the bank maintains capital K to meet total Value-at-Risk, then we have

K ¼ k  VaR

ð3:1Þ

where k is the proportion of capital that the intermediary holds per unit of VaR. The proportionality k
is potentially time varying. Hence, leverage L satisﬁes

L¼

A 1
A
1 1
¼ 
¼ 
K k VaR k V

where V is the unit value-at-risk, deﬁned as the value-at-risk per dollar of assets. Procyclical leverage
then follows directly from the counter-cyclical nature of unit value-at-risk. The negative relationship
between leverage and value-at-risk can also be seen in Table 3, column (v).
We can indeed see this counter-cyclical relationship in the data. In Fig. 13, we plot the unit valueat-risk against total assets, having removed the ﬁxed effects for individual banks. We see that the relationship is downward sloping. We highlight 2007Q4 and 2008Q1 for Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, as they are clear outliers in the plot. The high levels of unit value-at-risk for these two investment
banks leading up to the height of the credit crisis is suggestive of balance sheets that are under considerable stress. Shortly after ﬁling its 10-Q form for the ﬁrst quarter of 2008, Bear Stearns suffered its
run, and was acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase with the assistance of the Federal Reserve. Lehman Brothers ﬁled for bankruptcy in September of 2008.
In Fig. 14, we plot the evolution of the average unit value-at-risk over time. We see again that the
average unit value-at-risk increased sharply in 2007Q4 and 2008Q1.
Eq. (3.1) also suggests that the ratio of Value-at-Risk to shareholder equity may be an informative
series to track over time. The naive hypothesis would be that this ratio is kept constant over time by
the bank. The naive hypothesis also ties in neatly the regulatory capital requirements under the 1996

a marked increase in leverage. In 2007, both leverage and the VaR/equity ratio increased markedly for
most banks. In Fig. 16, we plot average leverage for all banks since 1992. There are two peaks in the

4. Forecasting risk appetite
We now explore the asset pricing consequences of balance sheet ﬂuctuations. We exhibit empirical
evidence that the waxing and waning of balance sheets have a direct impact on asset prices through
the ease with which traders, hedge funds and other users of credit can obtain funding for trades.
So far, we have used quarterly data drawn either from the balance sheets of individual ﬁnancial
intermediaries or the aggregate balance sheet items from the Flow of Funds accounts. However, for
the purpose of tracking the ﬁnancial market consequences of balance sheet adjustments, data at a
higher frequency are more useful. For this reason, we use the weekly data on the primary dealer repo
and reverse repo positions compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The primary dealer data
have previously been analyzed by Adrian and Fleming (2005) and Kambhu (2006).
Primary dealers are security-broker dealers with whom the Federal Reserve has a trading relationship. The primary dealers include the (then) ﬁve investment banks studied above, as well as commercial and foreign banks that own broker-dealers.5 The Federal Reserve collects transactions, positions,
ﬁnancing, and settlement data of the primary dealers in ﬁxed income markets. The data are consolidated
and released publicly on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York website.6 The primary dealer data provide
a valuable window on the overall market, at a frequency (every week) that is much higher than the usual
quarterly reporting cycle. Dealers collect information on their ﬁnancing activities each Wednesday; summary data are released each Thursday, one week after they are collected. The data are aggregated across
all dealers, and are only available by asset class.
Repos and reverse repos are a subset of the security ﬁnancing data. Financing distinguishes between ‘‘securities in” and ‘‘securities out” for each asset class. ‘‘Securities in” refer to securities received by a dealer in a ﬁnancing arrangement, whereas ‘‘securities out” refer to securities delivered
by a dealer in a ﬁnancing arrangement. For example, if a dealer enters into a repo, in which it borrows
funds and provides securities as collateral, it would report securities out. Repos and reverse repos are

reported across all sectors. Adrian and Fleming (2005) provide more detail about the data, and see
Dufﬁe (1996) and Fleming and Garbade (2003) for further details about repo markets.
We use the weekly repo and reverse repo data to forecast ﬁnancial market conditions in the following week. Our measure of ﬁnancial market conditions is the VIX index of implied volatility in S&P500
index options. The VIX index reﬂects aggregate ﬁnancial market volatility, as well as the price of risk of
market volatility. Ang et al. (2006) show that VIX innovations are signiﬁcant pricing factors for the
cross section of equity returns, and Bollerslev and Zhou (2007) show that the volatility risk premium
– the difference between the VIX and realized volatility of the S&P500 index – forecasts equity returns
better than other commonly used forecasting variables (such as the P/E ratio or the term spread). We
provide summary statistics of the primary dealer data, and the volatility data in Table 4.
We use the daily VIX data from the website of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com/micro/vix), and compute the S&P500 volatility from daily data over weekly windows. We compute the volatility risk premium as the difference between implied volatility and realized volatility.
This risk premium is closely linked to the payoff to volatility swaps, which are zero investment derivatives that return the difference between realized future volatility and implied volatility over the
maturity of the swap (see Carr and Wu (2009) for an analysis of variance and volatility swaps). We
then compute averages of the VIX and the variance risk premium over each week (from the close of
Wednesday to the close of the following Tuesday).
The growth rate of repos on dealers’ balance sheets signiﬁcantly forecast innovations in the VIX.
This can be seen in column (ii) of Table 5, where we report forecasting regressions for VIX changes
over the next week. The forecasting results are signiﬁcant at the 1% level. The forecasting R2 increases
from 4.9% when only the past VIX level is used, to 9% when repo changes are included in the forecast
(comparison of columns i and ii). We believe the latter result (the signiﬁcant forecasting power of
dealer’s repo growth for innovations in implied volatility) to be important. The forecasting result also
holds for reverse repos, consistent with the notion that it is the total size of the balance sheet that matters for aggregate liquidity (column ii).
In order to gain a better understanding what is determining the forecasting result, we also run the
forecasting regressions for S&P500 volatility and the volatility risk premium (columns v–viii). We see
that it is the volatility risk premium that is being forecast, not actual equity volatility. Adjustments to
the size of ﬁnancial intermediary balance sheets via repos thus forecasts the price of risk of aggregate
volatility, rather than aggregate volatility itself. We provide a graphical illustration of the forecasting
power of repos as a scatter chart in Fig. 17.
We can put forward the following economic rationale for the forecasting regressions presented
here. When balance sheets expand through the increased collateralized lending and borrowing by
ﬁnancial intermediaries, the newly released funding resources chase available assets for purchase.
More capital is deployed in increasing trading positions through the chasing of yield, and the selling

This table reports forecasting regressions of VIX implied volatility changes, S&P500 volatility changes, and the volatility risk
premium on lagged growth rates of repo, reverse repo, and net repo positions of U.S. Primary Dealers. The VIX is computed from
the cross section of S&P500 index option prices by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. We compute weekly volatility from
S&P500 returns. The volatility risk premium is the difference between the average VIX over the week and S&P500 volatility for
the same week. Summary statistics of the Primary Dealer ﬁnancing data are given in Table 4. The data are weekly from January
3, 1990–April 2, 2008. p-Values are adjusted for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.

of the ‘‘tails” , as in the selling volatility via options. If the increased funding for asset purchases result
in the generalized increase in prices and risk appetite in the ﬁnancial system, then the expansion of
balance sheets will eventually be reﬂected in the asset price changes in the ﬁnancial system – hence,
the ability of changes in repo positions to forecast future volatility, and particularly the volatility risk
premium.
Finally, we may expect that balance sheet changes will have an impact on real variables also, such
as the components of GDP. This is conﬁrmed in Adrian and Shin (2008b), who study implications for
the conduct of monetary policy. We do not pursue this issue further here, for lack of space.

5. Other related literature
Our results add to the literature on the role of liquidity in asset pricing. Gennotte and Leland (1990)
and Geanakoplos (2003) provide early analyses that are based on competitive equilibrium. As well as
those mentioned in the opening to our paper, recent contributions to the role of liquidity in asset pricing include Allen and Gale (2004), Acharya and Pedersen (2005), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2005,
2009), Morris and Shin (2004), Diamond and Rajan (2005). The common thread is the relationship between funding conditions and the resulting market prices of assets. Closely related is the literature
examining ﬁnancial distress and liquidity drains.
The managing of leverage is closely tied to the bank’s attempt to target a particular credit rating. To
the extent that the ‘‘passive” credit rating should ﬂuctuate with the ﬁnancial cycle, the fact that a
bank’s credit rating remains constant through the cycle suggests that banks manage their leverage actively, so as to shed exposures during downturns. Kashyap and Stein (2003) draw implications from
such behavior for the procyclical impact of the Basel II bank capital requirements.
More broadly, our discussion here is related to the large literature on the ampliﬁcation of ﬁnancial
shocks through balance sheet channels. The literature has distinguished two distinct channels. The
ﬁrst is the increased credit that operates through the borrower’s balance sheet, where increased lending comes from the greater creditworthiness of the borrower (Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Kiyotaki
and Moore (1997, 2005)). The second is the channel that operates through the banks’ balance sheets,
either through the liquidity structure of the banks’ balance sheets (Bernanke and Blinder (1988), Kashyap and Stein (2000)), or the cushioning effect of the banks’ capital (Van den Heuvel (2002)). Our discussion is closer to the latter group in that we also focus on the intermediaries’ balance sheets.
However, the added insight from our discussions is on the way that marking to market enhances
the role of market prices, and the responses that price changes elicit from intermediaries.
The impact of remuneration schemes on the ampliﬁcations of the ﬁnancial cycle have been addressed recently by Rajan (2005). The agency problems within a ﬁnancial institution holds important
clues on how we may explain procyclical behavior. Stein (1997) and Scharfstein and Stein (2000) present analyses of the capital budgeting problem within banks in the presence of agency problems.
The possibility that a market populated with Value-at-Risk (VaR) constrained traders may have
more pronounced ﬂuctuations has been examined by Danielsson et al. (2004). Mark-to-market
accounting may at ﬁrst appear to be an esoteric question on measurement, but we have seen that it
has potentially important implications for ﬁnancial cycles. Plantin et al. (2008) present a microeconomic model that compares the performance of marking to market and historical cost accounting
systems.
6. Concluding remarks
Aggregate liquidity can be understood as the rate of growth of the aggregate ﬁnancial sector balance sheet. When asset prices increase, ﬁnancial intermediaries’ balance sheets generally become
stronger, and – without adjusting asset holdings – their leverage tends to be too low. The ﬁnancial
intermediaries then hold surplus capital, and they will attempt to ﬁnd ways in which they can employ
their surplus capital. In analogy with manufacturing ﬁrms, we may see the ﬁnancial system as having
‘‘surplus capacity”. For such surplus capacity to be utilized, the intermediaries must expand their balance sheets. On the liability side, they take on more short-term debt. On the asset side, they search for
potential borrowers. Aggregate liquidity is intimately tied to how hard the ﬁnancial intermediaries
search for borrowers. In the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States we have seen that when
balance sheets are expanding fast enough, even borrowers that do not have the means to repay are
granted credit – so intense is the urge to employ surplus capital. The seeds of the subsequent downturn in the credit cycle are thus sown.
