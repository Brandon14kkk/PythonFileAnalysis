Abstract
We investigate the effect of say-on-pay (SOP) proposals on changes in executive and director compensation. Relative to non-SOP firms, SOP firms’ total compensation to CEOs does
not significantly change after the proposal. However, the mix of compensation does change—
companies move away from using cash compensation toward more incentive compensation,
offsetting the reduction in bonus. Further, the mix of compensation of non-CEO executives
changes similarly to that of CEOs. Compensation to directors of SOP firms increases less
than non-SOP firms. Firms whose CEOs are well compensated, especially with cash-based
compensation, are most likely to receive a proposal.

1. Introduction
With enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act, say-on-pay (SOP) became federal law starting on Jan. 21, 2011, giving shareholders an advisory (nonbinding) vote on executive compensation. With the passing
of the law, one important question emerges—will it affect executive compensation?
The effects of the new law will be difficult to observe for several years.1 Therefore,
we look to other sources to predict what will happen to U.S. executive compensation
after shareholders get their advisory vote. Specifically, we study a set of U.S. firms
that received an SOP proposal over the period 2006–2008 to provide unique insight
into how SOP legislation will affect companies in the coming years.
In our paper, we seek to understand whether shareholder scrutiny expressed
through SOP proposals affects company compensation practices. We measure how
compensation changes for CEOs after an SOP proposal is received. Further, as highlighted by the increasing concern over executive pay, it is not just the CEO whose
compensation is under fire, but all executives, so we examine compensation for nonCEO executives as well. Similarly, because many of the proposals brought forth
by shareholders state concern about board oversight and impartiality, we examine
changes in board compensation.2 By studying the composition of and change in
compensation for a sample of firms receiving proposals, we can better understand if
SOP matters and, more generally, understand if shareholder activism can affect real
change in a corporation.
We first focus our attention on CEO pay, since proposals highlight CEO pay.
We begin by examining the characteristics of firms targeted for the proposals. Over
the sample period, 2003–2008, the average CEO total compensation of $15.6 million
for a sample of 108 SOP firms is significantly greater than the $8 million for nonSOP firms. At the same time, SOP firms are significantly larger than non-SOP
firms. Multivariate results indicate that even after controlling for size and other firm
characteristics, companies with greater compensation are more likely to receive SOP
proposals. Both equity incentive and cash-based compensation are greater in SOP
firms.
Our primary focus is the effect of the proposals on executive pay. A natural
experiment is to compare changes in compensation for SOP firms pre- and postproposal. However, such a simple comparison would be contaminated by temporal
trends in compensation. To account for this, we employ a difference-in-difference
approach and compare the changes in executive pay for firms receiving an SOP

1 Few firms have adopted SOP; even after legislation it will be a year before the first round of shareholder
advisory votes on executive pay, and another year before the effects of those votes on compensation can
be measured.
2 In fact, some SOP proposals cite Brick, Palmon and Wald (2006) which shows that CEO pay tends to
be higher when director pay is higher. See, for instance, the Cendant SOP proposal in its 2006 proxy
statement: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723612/000119312506153385/ddef14a.htm

proposal to the changes for matched control firms that do not experience the proposals.
We identify control firms by the propensity score matching approach. Using the
compensation in the year prior to the proposal date as the benchmark year, we
compare it to compensation in the year after the proposal. The results show that
SOP firms increase their compensation less than non-SOP firms; non-SOP firms
experience an 11% increase in the median value of total compensation, while CEOs
of SOP firms experience a 4% median increase in total compensation. While this
difference is statistically significant in univariate results, it no longer is significant in
multivariate estimations that control for changes in firm characteristics.
In addition, we examine how the different components of compensation change
following the receipt of an SOP proposal. Boards must balance satisfying shareholders with satisfying executives so that the executives do not leave the firm. One way to
do this is to change the compensation mix—in other words, reduce one form of compensation, like cash compensation, and replace it with another form of compensation,
like options. We consider four forms of compensation: salary, bonus, restricted stock
grants (RSGs), and option grants.
Examining CEO compensation, we find that there is an overall shift from cash
compensation to equity-based compensation. The bonuses of SOP firms decrease
significantly more than those of non-SOP firms, in both the univariate analysis and
the multivariate analysis. At the same time, we observe a significant increase in
option grants for SOP CEOs versus non-SOP CEOs—options as a fraction of total
compensation increase by seven percentage points more for SOP firms than non-SOP
firms, whereas non-SOP firms actually experience a decrease in option compensation.
The use of restricted stock increases for both types of firms. The reduction in bonus
compensation and increase in equity performance-based compensation results in an
even higher pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) for SOP firms. The increased use
of option compensation as the form of performance-based compensation may reflect
a kind of compromise, one that enables managers to lever their compensation once
performance turns around while reducing cash as a percentage of compensation. In
summary, for SOP firms, the decrease in bonus is offset by increases in options
causing total compensation not to change significantly.
In addition to examining the impact of SOP proposals on CEO compensation, we
measure their bearing on the compensation of other executives and directors. Lazear
and Rosen (1981) and Kale, Reis and Venkateswaran (2009) argue that in order to
motivate executives to put forth more effort, a large spread in executive compensation
is needed to create a tournament. As a result, if CEO compensation packages change,
it is likely that other executives’ pay changes. Further, the proposal and its resulting
attention could potentially impact director pay. We explore the impact of the proposals
on directors’ compensation, specifically their cash, stock, and option awards.
In contrast to CEOs, the median compensation of other executives of SOP firms
decreases, whereas the compensation in benchmark firms increases. However, the
same switch from cash (salary and bonus) to equity-based compensation (restricted
stock and options) occurs for SOP executives. Directors of SOP firms also are affected

236

N. Burns and K. Minnick/The Financial Review 48 (2013) 233–258

by the proposals. Although there is a slight increase in average director pay for SOP
firms, this increase is significantly less than the increase that non-SOP directors
receive.
The SOP movement did not originate in the United States. In 2002, the United
Kingdom became the first country to enact SOP legislation, referred to as Directors
Remuneration Report Regulation (DRR), spurring a few studies on its consequences.
For instance, Ferri and Maber (2013), Alissa (2009), Carter and Zamora (2009),
and Conyon and Sadler (2010) examine the impact of DRR on pay in the United
Kingdom. However, there are significant differences in the way U.S. and U.K. CEOs
are compensated which may alter the outcome of SOP in the United States versus the
United Kingdom. In particular, the heavy use of incentive compensation, including
stock and option grants, is unique for U.S. firms. Ferri and Maber (2013) make the
comparison and find that cash compensation represents up to 67% of compensation to
U.K. CEOs, while it comprises up to 34% of compensation for U.S. CEOs. Moreover,
CEOs in the United States are paid more than those in the United Kingdom and
other countries (Fernandes, Ferreira, Matos and Murphy, 2009). Taken together these
findings suggest different cultures regarding pay. Because of this different pay culture,
exploring the impact of SOP proposals in the United States, specifically, is of merit.
Our study contributes to emerging studies on shareholder activism or shareholder voice in the United States. In general, Buchanan, Netter and Yang (2010)
find that corporate governance is becoming increasingly responsive to shareholder
activism expressed through proposals. Cai and Walking (2011) find that stock prices
with abnormal compensation respond more positively to the passage of SOP legislation in the House of Representatives, suggesting a potential impact of SOP. Ertimur,
Ferri and Muslu (2011) examine the relation between CEO pay and shareholder
activism as expressed through compensation related vote-no campaigns and alternative mechanisms to SOP. Eritmur, Ferri and Muslu (2011) conclude that vote-no
campaigns result in the most significant reductions in CEO pay and argue that they
share similarities with SOP voting. Our study adds to the research by directly examining the impact of individual SOP proposals on U.S. firms and shows that equity
compensation increases for SOP firms in the United States, more strongly linking
compensation to performance.

2. Background and relevant research
2.1. CEO compensation and SOP
Public outrage over compensation packages afforded to executives has recently
been highlighted in the press. From academics (“flawed compensation arrangements
have stemmed from defects in the underlying governance structure” [Bebchuk and
Fried, 2006, p. 16]), to practitioners (“executive compensation is ridiculously out of

N. Burns and K. Minnick/The Financial Review 48 (2013) 233–258

237

line with performance”3 ), and shareholders (“we believe that existing U.S. corporate
governance arrangements, including SEC rules and stock exchange listing standards,
do not provide shareholders with sufficient mechanisms for providing input to boards
on senior executive compensation”4 ), concerns are being voiced over CEO pay.
In theory, the owners of a firm will set compensation to incentivize managers
to maximize the wealth of the owners. However, because shareholders are dispersed,
they must hire a board to represent their interests, both to monitor the CEO and to
set compensation levels. As Shivdasani and Yermack (1999) and Cai, Garner and
Walking (2009) point out, these board members are, in turn, often selected by the
CEO. This may compromise board objectivity in setting compensation, resulting
in compensation contracts that are determined under less than optimal bargaining
conditions (Jensen and Murphy, 1990; Bebchuk and Fried, 2003). These conditions
sometimes result in a pay structure that reflects managerial rent seeking (Bertrand
and Mullainathan, 2001; Bebchuk, Fried and Walker 2002; Ryan and Wiggins, 2004).
At the extreme, as Brick, Palmon and Wald (2006) assert, director objectivity could
be especially inhibited in the event that “mutual back scratching” occurs in which
director compensation is tied to CEO compensation. Directors and CEOs, at the very
least, indirectly influence their own pay, and it is certainly rational for them to want
to influence that pay upward.
Regardless of the reasons why boards may not effectively set CEO pay, there is
investor and public discord regarding executive pay packages. Further, proposals by
investors suggest that board interests do not always align with shareholder interests
in setting executive pay.
Risk Metrics’ June 2008 SOP proposal offers an example of the rights that such
a proposal provides: “the Company’s shareholders will be given the opportunity to
vote on an advisory (nonbinding) resolution at each annual meeting to approve the
Company’s Compensation Discussion and Analysis as outlined in the annual proxy
statement.”5 The proposal requires shareholders to be given advisory votes on the
company’s overall executive compensation policies and on whether the firm executed
the policies appropriately. This extends the current rights of shareholders, under SEC
rules, to approve materially amended equity compensation plans, allowing them an
advisory vote for all forms of compensation.
Proponents of SOP argue that such initiatives will empower shareholders to
have an effect on executive pay, even though the vote is nonbinding. Bebchuk (2007)
posits that shareholder disagreement on pay packages expressed through SOP votes
might act as a constraint, resulting in more efficient bargaining between executives
and boards. This is similar to Jensen and Murphy’s (1990) argument that informal

political constraints truncate the upper tail of executive compensation. SOP provides
an opportunity for shareholders to impose reputational consequences on directors
by drawing public attention to their decisions involving compensation. For instance,
Johnson, Porter and Shackell (1997) find that negative media coverage over a firm’s
executive pay results in pay increases that are smaller in subsequent years, and in
increases in PPS.
Despite the fact that these votes are nonbinding, many executives oppose the
proposals.6 There is concern that shareholders may oppose pay packages without
due reason and therefore get in the way of the board functioning effectively and
efficiently, preventing the board from focusing on more pertinent issues (Deane,
2007). For instance, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein states that “shareholder
votes on executive pay would constrain directors from exercising judgment and hurt
the investment bank’s ability to attract the best employees. It would create a cloud,
a constraint, a limitation on decisions that have been at the heart of what a board
has done.”7 Further, firms argue that if SOP adoption were in the best interest of
the firm, boards would adopt it voluntarily. Finally, there is a question as to whether
shareholders have the expertise to evaluate or set executive pay in the first place.
Studies focusing on the United States indicate that SOP may have some effect.
For instance, Cai and Walkling (2011) examine the stock price reaction of firms in
response to the passage of SOP legislation in the House of Representatives. They find
that firms with more excessive CEO compensation and lower pay-for-performance,
and boards that respond more readily to shareholder pressure are impacted more
positively. In contrast to the focus of our study, they do not examine the impact of
the proposals on executive pay. Early research on shareholder proposals and CEO
compensation does not find a significant change in pay in response to the shareholder
pressure (Johnson, Porter and Shackell, 1997; Thomas and Martin, 1999), however.
Studies on shareholder voice also suggest that SOP might have some influence.
Most recently, Ertimur, Ferri and Muslu (2011) examine shareholder proposals on
compensation that are alternatives to SOP, in addition to vote-no campaigns. In
particular, they study the characteristics of firms that receive proposals and the kinds
of proposals that receive shareholder support. They conclude that, in contrast to
what SOP critics suggest, it does not appear that fringe shareholder groups are
trying to micromanage executive pay. They argue that compensation-related vote-no
campaigns share similarities with SOP in that they allow shareholders to express
general dissatisfaction with pay. We extend this research by explicitly examining the
impact of SOP proposals on executive compensation.
In the United Kingdom, Ferri and Maber (2013) find that cash compensation
becomes more sensitive to poor performance among firms adopting SOP. Conyon

and Sadler (2010) also examine changes in compensation among U.K. firms, but
find no significant change. Similarly, we study how compensation changes for U.S.
firms; however, since the components of U.S. compensation are more varied and
more equity-based, the sensitivity of compensation to performance can be modified
with more than just cash compensation, thus providing a richer environment to study
its effects.

2.2. Other executives’ compensation, board compensation and SOP
As highlighted by the increasing concern over executive pay, it is not just the
CEO whose compensation is under fire—all executives face a potential increase
in scrutiny. Further, Lazear and Rosen (1981) and Kale, Reis and Venkateswaran
(2009) argue that in order to motivate executives to put forth more effort, a large
spread in executive compensation is needed to create a tournament. As a result,
if CEO compensation packages change, it is likely that other executives’ pay also
changes. On the other hand, if maintaining the current tournament structure is not of
importance, then there may be no change in the pay of non-CEO executives.
Similarly, the proposal and its resulting attention could potentially impact director pay. A recent article on http://www.cnn.com/ highlights the potential lack of
independence between director and CEO pay.8 Ryan and Wiggins (2004) and Brick,
Palmon and Wald (2006) show that CEO pay tends to be higher when director pay is
higher. In fact, some SOP proposals cite Brick, Palmon and Wald (2006), as evidence
of the need for shareholder SOP. This indicates that shareholders are at least paying
attention to director pay and, that executives and directors are aware that shareholders
are paying attention. While earlier research documents a relation between director
and CEO pay, we recognize that the argument that SOP proposals will have an effect
on director pay is tenuous. We therefore empirically examine for any effects.
We focus on SOP proposals targeting individual companies in the United States.
We examine the characteristics associated with a firm being targeted with an SOP
proposal. In addition, we measure the changes in compensation occurring to targeted
firms’ CEOs, non-CEO executives, and the board. Ours is the first study that we
know of to examine the impact of individual SOP proposals on U.S. firms. It is also
the first to explore its impact on other executives and board members.

3. Empirical analysis
3.1. Data and overview of the compensation environment
We collect a sample of 137 SOP proposals over the period 2007–2008 from
Capstone Research and ProxyDemocracy.org. To test whether the SOP proposals
affect compensation, we require data to calculate the changes in compensation in the
8 http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/04/news/companies/director_compensation.fortune/index.htm

240

fiscal year before the proposal and the fiscal year after it. Compensation data are
obtained from ExecuComp. After conditioning on the availability of compensation
data for these firms from ExecuComp, we lose 27 observations. We drop Apple’s two
proposals from our sample because the CEO only receives $1 in salary—a significant
outlier. This results in a sample of 108 proposals from 76 companies. Accounting
data are from Compustat and market data from CRSP.
First, we observe compensation levels from 2003 to 2008 to see if there are any
structural changes in compensation over those six years. Examining this period is
important because activists’ incentives to bring forth SOP proposals likely stems from
both the company’s and overall trends in the compensation environment; for instance,
Murphy (1995) suggests that discrepancy in executive pay and average worker pay
seems to coincide with public outrage over executive compensation.
We focus on five compensation measures: salary, bonus, value of option grants,
value of the RSGs, and total compensation (the sum of salary, bonus, other annual
compensation, RSGs, long-term incentive plan payouts, all other compensation, and
the value of option grants). We examine the levels of compensation because most
news reports on executive pay discuss levels of pay as opposed to the percentage of
compensation that is equity, etc. In fact, it would seem that high levels of stock options
are described in the same manner as cash compensation. In addition, we scale each
form of compensation by total compensation to understand how large a component
it is of the total compensation package. This acknowledges that investors, whether
they are sophisticated institutional or individual investors, potentially, also focus on
the structure of compensation to incentivize management. We show the trend over
time for both total compensation and the ratio of the compensation components in
Figure 1, Panels A and B, respectively.
Despite the inclusion of the recent financial crisis, we find an upward trend in
total compensation: average compensation is $4.8 million in 2003 versus $7.2 million
in 2008. Panel B of Figure 1 shows that salaries increase slightly over the period,
with bonus showing evidence of stagnation or even decline. More notably, RSGs
have been on the rise. While the use of RSGs increased, the value of options granted
has decreased slightly, particularly over the period 2005–2007, picking up again in
2008. This is consistent with firms trying to reduce managerial risk-taking incentives
or may reflect a reduction in incentives to compensate with options due to recent
accounting changes (Carter and Zamora, 2009).

3.2. Description of the sample
Panel A of Table 1 shows a breakout of the SOP proposals. Over the period 2006–
2008, the popularity of SOP proposals significantly increases. While there were only
three SOP proposals in 2006, there were 48 in 2007 and 57 in 2008. In 2006, no
proposals passed, while in 2007 and 2008, only five and 11 passed, respectively.
However, the activist shareholders that introduced the proposals are persistent. Panel
B of Table 1 shows the frequency of the proposals. Thirty-three of the proposals were

Summary statistics
This table reports descriptive summary statistics for say-on-pay (SOP) firms and non-SOP firms. The
sample consists of 108 firms receiving an SOP proposal. The non-SOP firms are firms in ExecuComp that
did not receive an SOP proposal and for which requisite data are available. Panel A shows the total number
of proposals and the number that passed each year. Panel B shows the number of times the SOP proposal
is brought to a company and the number of proposals passed on each attempt. Panel C shows the ten most
common industries in the SOP sample. Panel D shows the firm variables. Cash flow is measured as net
income plus depreciation divided by total assets. Return on assets is net income divided by total assets.
Market-to-book is total liabilities plus market value of equity divided by total assets. Leverage is the ratio
of long-term debt to total assets. The 12-month return is the 12-month compound return.

$73.8 billion ($40.4 billion), whereas the benchmark firms have a market cap of $7.9
billion ($2.7 billion). Growth options, measured by total liabilities plus market value
of equity divided by total assets, are significantly larger in non-SOP firms. The firms
are similar in terms of leverage (the ratio of long-term debt to total assets) and cash
flows (the sum of net income and depreciation divided by total assets). The proposal
year of the SOP firms is preceded by poor performance relative to non-SOP firms,
as measured by the 12-month compounded return (an average of –13% versus 1%
for SOP firms and benchmark firms, respectively), which may be the catalyst for the
proposals.

3.3. The likelihood of receiving an SOP proposal
To gain insight into the characteristics of firms that are targeted with an SOP
proposal, we model the likelihood of an SOP proposal in a logistic regression with an
indicator variable equal to 1 in the year of the SOP proxy. Our control sample includes
all ExecuComp firms that have the required data over the period 2003–2008 but have
not had any SOP proposals. However, while any firm can be targeted for SOP, we find
that SOP firms are significantly larger than non-SOP firms. Therefore, we eliminate
any control firms that have total assets less than the smallest SOP firm ($627.2
million, unreported), resulting in 1,202 control firms. The advantages of including
all non-SOP firms is that the sample is reflective of the total population of firms; we
have statistical power to identify ways in which SOP firms differ from the population,
and the logistic regressions do not overstate the probability a given firm will receive
a proposal. We explore the likelihood of a proposal based on total compensation and
other firm characteristics. We include controls associated with receiving a proposal
(Karpoff, Malatesta and Walkling, 1996; Cai and Walkling, 2011; Eritmur, Ferri

244

N. Burns and K. Minnick/The Financial Review 48 (2013) 233–258

and Muslu, 2011)—a proxy for size (sales), performance (return on assets [ROA],
12-month return), market-to-book and leverage, measured in year (t−1) where t is the
proposal year. For a subset of firms for which we obtain data from the IRRC database,
we include the Bebchuk, Cohen and Farrell (2009) measure of entrenchment index,
board size, CEO duality, the percentages of the board and compensation committee
that is independent, and a proxy for busy boards (the average number of other boards
that independent directors hold). All regressions control for industry (Fama-French
49 industries) and year effects.
Table 2 presents results. Regression (1) shows that after controlling for firm size
and other firm characteristics, higher total compensation is significantly associated
with receiving an SOP proposal. Specifications (2) and (3) add governance—the
number of observations falls to 1,887 from 2,902 as a result of data availability. Total
compensation retains its significance. In regression (3) we substitute the fraction
of compensation that is cash-based (salary and bonus) and equity-based (restricted
stock and options). Each is significant, although cash-based compensation has a larger
coefficient indicating that cash is a slightly more important factor than equity. Size is
significantly positive in both specifications, thus, proposals might be targeted to firms
that are more visible to the public. With respect to the governance characteristics,
large and busy boards are more likely to receive an SOP proposal. Similar to Ertimur,
Ferri and Muslu (2011), we find that boards with greater independence are more
likely to be targeted and that the entrenchment index is negatively associated with
being targeted.9 It is possible that shareholders predict less success in generating
change if the CEO is entrenched in the company, and, therefore, do not waste their
resources by presenting a proposal.
In summary, SOP firms seem to be large firms with greater total compensation.
Our results are consistent with Ferracone’s (2010) study of CEO pay, which concludes
that the top 5% of CEOs who are paid highly attract attention that leads to the
impression that all CEOs are paid very highly. The results also are consistent with
Eritmur, Ferri and Muslu (2011) who show that compensation-related activism is
associated with higher levels of CEO total and equity-based pay.

4. Changes in compensation and say-on-pay
4.1. Compensation data
The central focus of our study is to test for changes in compensation due
to the SOP proposal. To do so, we use a difference-in-difference approach as in
Cheng and Farber (2008). This approach takes into account changes in compensation
due to industry and other time invariant characteristics. The difference-in-difference
estimate also assumes that the SOP firms’ compensation will have followed the same
trend as the non-SOP firms’ compensation.
9 Ertimur,

Ferri and Muslu (2011) provide a possible explanation for this.

Table 2
The likelihood of receiving an SOP proposal
This table reports the logistic regression estimations for the likelihood of receiving a say-on-pay (SOP)
proposal. The dependent variable is equal to 1 if the company receives an SOP proposal. The sample
consists of 108 SOP and non-SOP firms identified over the period 2006–2008 that have data on ExecuComp,
Compustat, and CRSP. Board data are from the IRRC database. Total compensation is the sum of salary,
bonus, other annual compensation, RSGs, long-term incentive plan payouts, and all other compensation.
Cash/total compensation is the sum of salary and bonus, divided by total compensation. Incentive/total
compensation is the sum of stock and option compensation divided by total compensation. Board size is
the size of the board. CEO is chair is equal to 1 if the CEO is chair of the board. Entrenchment index is
from Bebchuk, Cohen and Farrell (2009). % Board independence is the percentage of the board that is
independent. % Indep. on compensation is the percentage of the compensate committee that is independent.
% Busy board is the average number of boards independent directors sit on. Other control variables are as
defined in Table 1, Panel D. All independent variables are measured one year prior to the SOP proposal
year. We also control for industry and year effects. Standard errors are shown in parentheses.

To make our comparison of SOP firms with control firms more precise, we
find control firm matches using a propensity score. The propensity score is the
probability that a firm with given characteristics is an SOP firm. In their seminal
papers, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) and Rubin (1997) show that propensity score
matching removes biases between samples. Drucker and Puri (2005) argue that it is
superior to commonly used simple industry-size matching. To match firms based on
the propensity scores, we use a Probit model that includes the factors affecting the
likelihood of receiving an SOP proposal, including industry, year, size (measured by
log of sales), and performance. Because the non-SOP sample is sufficiently large,
we employ a 1-to-N matched sample, reducing the standard errors relative to using
a one-to-one sample match. The average difference between the propensity score of
the SOP sample and the benchmarks is 0.003. After matching, the firms are no longer
significantly different in terms of firm characteristics. The return of matched nonSOP firms is 0.01 while SOP remains at –0.13 (reported in Table 1, Panel D for SOP
firms).10 After applying the propensity score matching technique, the mean (median)
market capitalization of non-SOP firms is now $66.3 million ($27.2 million), with
sales of $43.1 million ($16.2 million). The market to book ratio is higher, though not
significantly, for non-SOP firms, with an average of 1.47.

4.2. Analysis of changes in CEO compensation
Panel A of Table 3 reports summary statistics on CEO pay in SOP and matched
firms. The univariates show that SOP firms receive a greater fraction of their compensation in the form of equity pay relative to matched firms, and that total compensation
is higher with a mean of $17 million ($14 million) versus $8 million ($6 million)
for non-SOP firms. Both cash and equity-based pay are higher in SOP firms, as well
as PPS. PPS is measured according to Core and Guay (1999), and measures the
change in wealth from equity-based pay for a 1% change in stock price. Panel B
of Table 3 compares the change in the compensation between the SOP firms from
the year before to the year after the proposal is received, with the respective change
for non-SOP firms. Median total compensation increases 4% for SOP firms and less
than the 11% for benchmark firms. The averages are much greater with average total
compensation increasing 38% in SOP firms and 51% in non-SOP firms.11 We also
examine the percent change in the various forms of the compensation components:
It becomes evident that SOP firms are substituting more incentive compensation for
bonus compensation. Bonus compensation decreases by 8% as a fraction of total

10 When we exclude financials, the performance of the sample and control firms is no longer significantly
different. Similarly, performance is not significant in the multivariate estimations of the likelihood of a
proposal because the financials indicator picks up the effect (unreported). When we exclude financials
from the sample, results from an analysis of changes in compensation are qualitatively similar.

Table 3
CEO compensation for SOP firms
This table reports summary statistics for CEO compensation in say-on-pay (SOP) and matched non-SOP
firms. Panel A reports the fraction and levels of the components of compensation measured at time
(t−1) for SOP firms. Panel B reports the changes in compensation. The compensation variables include
salary, bonus, the value of restricted stock grants (RSGs), the value of option grants, pay-for-performance
sensitivity (PPS), total cash compensation, total equity incentive compensation, and total compensation
(TDC1). Cash compensation is the sum of salary and bonus. Equity compensation is the sum of RSG and
options. TDC1 is the sum of salary, bonus, other annual compensation, RSGs, long-term incentive plan
payouts, and all other compensation. Pairwise t-tests and rank tests are used to examine whether there is a
significant difference between the benchmark and SOP firms in mean and median, respectively.

compensation in SOP firms in comparison to 6% in non-SOP firms. Both option and
restricted stock compensation become a larger fraction of total compensation in SOP
firms. The use of restricted stock also increases for the non-SOP sample; however,
the options for non-SOP firms decrease as a fraction of total compensation. It is
possible that the benchmark firms are replacing option compensation with restricted

248

stock compensation, while the SOP firms still are more heavily relying on option
compensation.
In a multivariate framework, we explore the impact of SOP proposals on compensation, controlling for firm-level attributes that affect compensation. Because we
are measuring the impact on changes in compensation, we also measure the change
in firm-level characteristics that affect compensation. As in prior research (Core and
Guay, 1999; Cheng and Farber, 2008), we use the lagged changes of the control
variables. Specifically, we model:
Compensation type(t−1,t+1) = α0 + α1 SOP + α2 compensationt−2
+ βi Controls(t−2,t) + Year Indicators
+ Industry Indicators + ε.

(1)

We estimate Equation (1) using the percent change in compensation measures
as dependent variables: the percent change is measured as the difference in the
component as a fraction of total compensation in year (t+1) relative to year (t−1).
SOP is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the firm received an SOP proposal. We
control for basic firm characteristics and those associated with compensation design.
Control variables include the natural log of sales as a proxy for size—larger firms
tend to have larger compensation packages. Further, Core and Guay (1999) argue that
because larger firms may be more complex, equity incentive levels may need to be
greater to counter agency problems. We also include leverage. Bryan, LeeSeok and
Lilien (2000) find that leverage is negatively associated with equity compensation,
suggesting that debt acts as a substitute for monitoring, thus reducing the need
for stock-based compensation. Firms with better prior performance should reward
executives for the performance; thus there should be a positive relationship between
performance and compensation (Hanlon, Rajgopal and Shevlin, 2003). We use two
measures of performance: the 12-month return described previously and profitability,
calculated as net income divided by total assets. Firms experiencing more cash
constraints possibly switch to greater equity compensation; we control for cash flow
using net income plus depreciation divided by total assets. Finally, we include lagged
total compensation to take into account any effect of the level of compensation
on changes in compensation. For instance, a CEO who is paid at the top of his
pay scale may experience smaller increases in compensation than a CEO who is
paid significantly less. Year and industry dummies (Fama-French 49 industries) are
included to control for any time and industry effects.
Panel A of Table 4 reports results for the regressions of compensation on the
SOP dummy and controls. It is important to keep in mind that in a difference-indifference regression, to be significant, the change must be greater for SOP firms
relative to non-SOP firms. We start with cash compensation in models (1) and (2).
The results also show that bonus as a fraction of total compensation decreases more for
SOP firms—by 2.1 percentage points—while salary’s fraction of total compensation
increases more in SOP firms. Whereas the univariates show that option and RSGs

Multivariate Analysis
The sample consists of 108 say-on-pay (SOP) and propensity-score matched control firms. SOP is an
indicator variable that equals 1 if the company receives an SOP proposal. The dependent variable in
regressions (1) through (4) is the percent change in the respective component of compensation as a
fraction of total compensation. The dependent variable in regressions (5) and (6) are the percent change in
PPS and total compensation. All of the dependent variables are measured at time (t−1) to (t+1), where t is
the year the proposal is received. Unexercisable option/TDC1 and exercisable option/TDC1 are the value
of unexercisable and exercisable options adjusted by total compensation. Control variables are defined in
Table 3 and are lagged relative to the dependent variables. Industry and year-fixed effects are included
(unreported). Standard errors are shown in parentheses.

firms. While the use of RSGs as a fraction of total compensation increases for both
sets of firms; it increases 4.6% less for SOP firms than for non-SOP firms (estimation

compensation does not change significantly more for SOP firms than non-SOP firms.
We conclude that after receiving an SOP proposal, directors alter the compensation
mix away from bonuses and toward other forms of incentive compensation, especially
option compensation for SOP firms. Given the poor performance of SOP firms,
options provide executives a way to tie their compensation to performance, creating
a motivation for a turnaround of performance. This is consistent with Ferracone’s
(2010) conjecture that firms use more stock options in low-performance years. We
note that because total compensation does not decrease significantly for SOP firms
relative to non-SOP, and it appears that options are being substituted for bonuses.
The control variables include changes in size, ROA, free cash flow, returns,
growth, and debt. In the regressions for option compensation, we include changes

N. Burns and K. Minnick/The Financial Review 48 (2013) 233–258

251

in exercisable and unexercisable options. Following Cai and Walkling (2011) we do
not include changes in market-to-book in the regressions using cash compensation—
salary and bonus—because accounting-based measures are more important for cash
compensation than market measures. However, results are similar if we include this
proxy for growth opportunities. As expected, ROA is positively associated with bonus
compensation. It is also significantly associated with RSGs. Firms with higher cash
flows seem to have higher total compensation and more bonus compensation. Finally,
in general, performance as measured by lagged market returns is positively associated
with the components of compensation.
The proposals passed for some SOP firms and not for others. For robustness,
we include an indicator equal to 1 if the proposal passes, and we report the results
in Panel B of Table 4. The results largely mirror the results in Panel A; however,
the coefficient on the SOP dummy is no longer significant for the percent change in
RSGs (model 3). The passed indicator is not significant in any specification. This
suggests that it is the action of bringing the proposal forth that matters, not whether
the proposal actually passes.12
In summary, while the board of directors does not significantly decrease total
compensation when faced with SOP proposals, it changes the mix of compensation.
Both SOP and non-SOP firms use more restricted stock and options. The percent
option compensation of total compensation increases more for SOP firms. This
change in compensation mix may help retain talent. Further, utilizing more options
allows managers to lever their payoffs once performance is turned around (see e.g.,
Dodonova and Khoroshilov, 2006; Brookman, Chang and Rennie, 2007). To do so,
boards move away from cash compensation and rely more heavily on incentive
compensation.

4.3. The impact of SOP on other executives and board members
We examine other executives’ and board members’ pay. Given that there is
more than one executive for each firm, we measure the average of their compensation
components for each firm-year. For directors, ExecuComp changed the way it records
data starting in 2007. To make the pre-2007 data compatible with the post-2007 data,
we do the following: Pre-2007, we calculate total cash fees as the annual director
retainer plus director meeting fee multiplied by the number of meetings. The value of
director option awards is calculated as the options received by all directors plus max
additional options, each multiplied by the per-option value. Given that ExecuComp
does not report the per-option value for directors, and because the options granted
to directors typically resemble those given to the CEO (Brick, Palmon and Wald,
12 In unreported results, we also examine shareholder support for the proposals and find that more shareholder support leads to lower cash and total compensation. Additionally, we examine union-supported
proposals and find that union support does not matter. Finally, since part of our SOP sample received
multiple proposals, we examine whether the number of tries matters, and results are qualitatively the same.

252

2006), we use the CEO per-option value as our measure of the value of a given
director option. In addition, we calculate the value of stock awards to directors as the
total shares received by directors multiplied by the close price at fiscal-year end. For
the post-2007 director compensation, we measure total cash fees as cash fees plus
nonequity incentive compensation and then average each component of compensation
across directors for a firm. We calculate PPS using the average vesting period and
strike price of the options granted to CEOs to extrapolate the vesting period of the
directors’ options. In each subperiod, total compensation is the sum of total cash fees,
stock awards, and option awards. Note that the stock awards are equity, not restricted
stock as for executives and CEOs.
We use the same methodology and firms to explore the change in compensation
for other executives as in the analysis for CEOs. In addition to the controls used
in the CEO analysis, we also control for changes in CEO compensation because
the changes in executive compensation should change with CEO compensation,
particularly if the firm is maintaining a tournament structure. Similar to the setup for
CEOs, we control for the executives’ or board members’ lagged total compensation.
In this section, when we use the term executive compensation, we are referring to
non-CEO executive compensation.
Panel A of Table 5 shows the univariate statistics for the percent change
in both other executives’ compensation and directors’ compensation. Similarly
to the CEOs, we see that the executives at SOP firms experience a decrease in
their bonus following the proposal, around 9% on average versus a 4% reduction in the bonus of non-SOP executives. Options and RSGs increase for the
non-CEOs for an overall increase in equity-based compensation. There is a 9%
decrease in median other executives’ total compensation for SOP firms, whereas
the non-SOP firms’ executives experience a median increase of 11% in total
compensation.
Panel B of Table 5 shows the change in the components of the directors’ compensation. It is interesting to note that although the directors of SOP firms experience
an increase in total compensation, the increase is significantly lower than non-SOP
directors’ increase over the same period. This suggests that director pay has increased
over the past few years, perhaps in response to the additional risk and work that directors have taken on in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley environment. However, SOP directors
do not receive the same increases in compensation that non-SOP directors receive.
There is not much difference in the change in the various ratios of director compensation when comparing SOP firms to non-SOP firms, except that option grants
decrease more significantly for SOP firms.
Table 6 shows the multivariate estimations. Models (1) through (6) focus on
non-CEO executives. For SOP executives, both bonus and salary as a fraction of
compensation decrease more than for non-SOP executives. Each of these is significant at the 1% level. In contrast, options and restricted stock as a fraction of total
compensation each increase more for SOP firms relative to non-SOP. Again, cash
compensation is being at least partially replaced with equity compensation resulting

Table 5

Changes in compensation for other executives and directors of say-on-pay (SOP) and control firms
This table reports the mean values and percent changes in other executives’ compensation and directors’
compensation between years (t−1) and (t+1) for SOP and non-SOP firms, where t is the year of the
proposal. Panel A reports the changes in the ratios of compensation for other executives. The compensation
ratio variables include salary, bonus, the value of restricted stock grants (RSGs), and the value of option
grants, all adjusted by total compensation (TDC1). Cash compensation is salary plus bonus divided by
total compensation. Incentive compensation is restricted stock plus options divided by total compensation.
PPS is pay-for-performance sensitivity. Panel B shows the change in these ratios for directors. We use
pairwise t-tests and rank tests to determine whether there is a significant difference between the benchmark
and SOP firms in mean and median, respectively.

This table reports the multivariate estimations for the change in compensation of non-CEO executives and directors. Regressions (1) through (6) report results for
non-CEO executives. Regressions (7) though (11) report results for directors. Say-on-pay (SOP) is an indicator variable that equals 1 if the company receives an
SOP proposal. The observations consist of 108 SOP and propensity-matched control firms. For non-CEO executives, the compensation variables include salary,
bonus, the value of restricted stock grants (RSGs), the value of option grants, and total compensation (TDC1). TDC1 is the sum of salary, bonus, other annual
compensation, RSGs, long-term incentive plan payouts, and all other compensation. For boards, compensation is option, stock, and cash compensation; TDC1
is the sum of these. We control for industry and year effects (unreported). All of the changes are measured at time (t−1) to (t+1), where t is the year the proposal
is received. Standard errors are shown in parentheses.

that CEO pay affects executive pay. While greater compensation in the past is associated with lower increases in options and restricted stock, it is positively associated
with salary and bonus; however, on the whole, changes in total compensation are lower
when prior compensation is higher. Bonus increases with performance whether measured by ROA or market returns. Salary also increases with performance. Finally,
option compensation is positively related to growth options, as expected. Option
compensation increases with exercisable options and decreases with unexercisable
options, consistent with the replacement of options.
In models (7) through (11), we present the results for directors’ compensation,
which consists of cash, equity (not restricted stock), and options. We find that the
total compensation of directors of SOP firms increases significantly less than that of
directors of control firms. This is due primarily to reductions in option awards and
a smaller increase in cash as percentages of total compensation, while changes in
stock compensation are not significantly different from those in non-SOP firms. In
summary, it seems that directors may reduce their amount of option grants in response
to the shareholder disapproval expressed by the proposal. With respect to the control
variables, stock and option compensation to directors is positively related to CEO
compensation; except for cash, the coefficients on total director compensation are
negative and significant, and profitability is positively related to stock and option
compensation.

5. Conclusion
Executive compensation seems to undergo cycles of scrutiny often coinciding
with market downturns. However, as CEO pay of larger publicly traded firms has
increased dramatically compared to that of the average worker—CEO pay was 84
times higher in 1985 but 262 times higher in 200013 —investors and the public at large
are taking more concrete and permanent action. SOP proposals are an example of
shareholders voicing their concern not only for the duration of the market downturn,
but also for the future. SOP allows shareholders to have a more active and permanent,
though nonbinding, voice in executive pay in the future by having an advisory role
in compensation of a firm. However, there is a debate over whether SOP provisions
actually have any merit when it comes to real change in compensation. We test
whether SOP proposals do indeed help to change compensation.
We find that although total compensation increases insignificantly less for SOP
firms than for non-SOP firms, SOP companies use more incentive-based compensation and less cash-based compensation. Option grants increase for both samples,
though more so for SOP firms. A significant decrease in bonus compensation for
SOP firms further marks a shift from cash compensation toward performance-based
compensation.

Our results show that even though the SOP votes are nonbinding, SOP likely
serves a purpose by providing an avenue for shareholders to voice their concerns. The
SOP proposal does not need to pass in order to enact change—companies change the
mix of compensation just by receiving an SOP proposal. It is even possible that some
firms voluntarily move away from cash compensation just to avoid an SOP proposal.14
Our results may be understated if mandatory SOP encourages monitoring of more
firms. Our findings contribute to the research on the increasing role of shareholder
voice and, more specifically, provide more information on the SOP initiatives debate.
