This paper examines pricing and arbitrage opportunities in the New
Zealand bank bill futures market using an intraday data set. The key ﬁndings are: (a) the implied forward rate model yields biased estimates of
the bill futures yield but the bias is small and not economically signiﬁcant;
(b) ex post synthetic bill opportunities are more numerous than ex post
quasi-arbitrage opportunities but the yield enhancements are minor; (c) ex
post quasi-arbitrage opportunities are substantially less frequent and less
proﬁtable than reported by prior studies using closing data; and (d) arbitrage opportunities decline when execution delays are introduced but the
declines are not statistically signiﬁcant. In broad terms, the bill futures
market is efﬁcient with respect to quasi-arbitrage but less so with respect
to synthetic bill opportunities. The results also suggest that arbitrage

the interbank bill market. The incidence of arbitrage opportunities is on a
par with levels reported in intraday studies of stock index and foreign
exchange markets. This illustrates the importance of using high frequency

1. INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates pricing and arbitrage opportunities in the bank
bill futures contract traded on the New Zealand Futures and Options
Exchange (NZFOE) using an intraday data set. This paper is in large part
motivated by Goodhart and O’Hara’s (1997) plea for research into interest rate markets using high-frequency data. The paucity of research in
this area is primarily due to the lack of archival data.
Prior research in the Treasury bill futures contract traded on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange has documented significant mispricing
and/or substantial arbitrage opportunities (e.g., Chow & Brophy, 1982;
Elton, Gruber, & Rentzler, 1984; Hegde & Branch, 1985; Lang &
Rasche, 1978; Puglisi, 1978; Rendleman & Carabini, 1979). For example, the frequency of arbitrage opportunities is estimated at 63.8% for
synthetic bill arbitrage (Elton et al., 1984), 40% for quasi-arbitrage
(Lang & Rasche, 1978) and 26.5% for pure arbitrage (Elton et al.,
1984).1 The latter study also found a substantial number of instances
where pure arbitrage proﬁts exceeded $500 per $1 million of face value
of Treasury bills. This is in sharp contrast to research in foreign exchange
and stock index futures markets which found relatively few, and not
exceptionally proﬁtable, formal arbitrage opportunities (e.g., Buhler &
Kempf, 1995; Lim, 1992; Rhee & Chang, 1992).
The frequency and size of arbitrage opportunities suggests that the
Treasury bill futures market is not transactionally efficient. However,
these prior studies suffer from a number of limitations. The first is the
widespread use of an inappropriate forward pricing model to generate fair

1

Synthetic bill arbitrage occurs when investors create synthetic bills by combining an m (n)-day bill
with a position in the bill futures market to generate a return superior to that on a pure n (m)-day
bill. Quasi-arbitrage and pure arbitrage are strategies that involve taking simultaneous positions in
the bill and bill futures market such that a guaranteed proﬁt can be made with zero initial investment. The distinction between quasi-arbitrage and pure arbitrage hinges on whether or not the arbitrageur has a portfolio of bills. Quasi-arbitrage describes the situation where the arbitrageur raises
funds to purchase an n-day bill (m-day bill) by selling an m-day bill (n-day bill) from his bill portfolio. The term “pure arbitrage” is reserved for situations where the arbitrageur does not hold bills and
must therefore raise funds by short-selling bills.

or theoretical Treasury bill futures yields. Vignola and Dale (1980) and
Kawaller and Koch (1984) showed that mispricing is substantially less
when the cost of carry (COC) model is employed in place of the implied
forward rate (IFR) model that is employed in other studies.2
Unfortunately these two studies examined neither the frequency nor the
size of arbitrage opportunities.
Second, with the notable exception of Elton et al. (1984), prior
studies used daily closing yield data. The time difference between the
closing of the Treasury bill market in New York and the end of Treasury
bill futures trading in Chicago automatically induced error into the
measurement of the futures/forward differential and the identiﬁcation of
arbitrage opportunities.
A third issue relates to the measurement of transaction costs.
Several studies (e.g., Elton et al., 1984; Hegde & Branch, 1985) compared the gross proﬁts from arbitrage opportunities with estimated transaction costs of $175. Such an assumption is inappropriate when transaction costs are influenced by the term to maturity of the bill futures
contract. In these circumstances, employing a ﬁxed level of transaction
costs will lead to errors in measuring the frequency and proﬁtability of
arbitrage opportunities. Confusion between different arbitrage strategies
has also led to the use of erroneous transaction cost estimates, compromising the validity of some results (e.g., Rendleman & Carabini, 1979).
The research design of this study addresses these speciﬁc issues and
incorporates other advances from the stock index futures literature.
With regard to model selection, it employs the IFR model to generate
theoretical bill futures yields since prior research by Poskitt (1998) has
shown this model to be appropriate for pricing the bill futures contract
traded on the NZFOE.3 Second, the potential for measurement error is
largely mitigated by employing an intraday data set comprising timestamped bid/ask quote data for the major bill maturities in the bill market and time-stamped transaction and quote data from the bill futures
2

Vignola and Dale (1980) and Kawaller and Koch (1984) argue that the repo arbitrage-based costof-carry model should be used to study arbitrage opportunities in the Treasury bill futures market
since the price of the Treasury bill futures contract is determined at the margin by the repo arbitrage
activities of dealers in U.S. government securities.
3
Poskitt (1998) ﬁnds that the bill futures contract traded on the NZFOE is priced more accurately
by the IFR model than by the COC model and offers proﬁts considerably smaller than U.S. studies
report. For example, he ﬁnds that 82.7% of the closing futures yields lie within the IFR-based noarbitrage zone but the corresponding ﬁgure for the COC model is only 45.8%. The author attributes
the superior performance of the IFR model to the prominent role played by interbank dealers in the
New Zealand money market. These participants are the price-setters since they face the lowest
transaction costs of all participants and hold substantial portfolios of bills of varied maturities which
can be drawn upon to implement quasi-arbitrage trades.

market. The nature of the bill market bid/ask quote data captured by
Reuters means that nonsynchronicity, which is an important issue in
studies of the stock and stock index futures markets using high-frequency
data, is not an issue in this study. Third, the paper uses standard noarbitrage arguments and transaction cost data to derive no-arbitrage
bounds for the two main types of arbitrage strategies employed in New
Zealand, synthetic bill arbitrage and quasi-arbitrage (see Appendices 1
and 2). Comparative statics show that the width of the synthetic bill noarbitrage zone is approximately constant as bill futures expiration
approaches while the width of the quasi-arbitrage no-arbitrage zone
narrows appreciably (see Appendices 3 and 4).4 In addition, this paper
considers the impact on the frequency and proﬁtability of arbitrage of
much shorter, and more realistic, execution delays than Elton et al.
(1984) were able to consider. Lastly, this paper attempts to avoid the
potential selection bias introduced by the use of transaction data rather
than quote data. Phillips and Smith (1980) observed that transaction
data potentially overstate both the frequency and profitability of arbitrage opportunities since arbitrage trades systematically use prices from
the wrong side of the bid/ask spread. This selection bias can be avoided
if arbitrage opportunities are evaluated using the bill futures best bid and
best ask quote data provided by Reuters rather than the transaction data
provided by the NZFOE.
This paper ﬁnds that the IFR model gives biased estimates of the
bill futures yield. However, the bias is small and not economically significant. Quasi-arbitrage opportunities are scarce and much less proﬁtable
than documented in prior studies. However, synthetic bill opportunities
are more numerous, although the gains are still quite small. Both the
number and average proﬁtability of quasi-arbitrage opportunities decline
when execution lags are introduced but the declines are not statistically
signiﬁcant. The results also suggest that arbitrage opportunities are not
generally available to arbitrageurs without access to the interbank bill
market. Overall, the bill futures market is highly efﬁcient with respect to
quasi-arbitrage opportunities but less efﬁcient with respect to synthetic
4

The intuition for the quasi-arbitrage result is as follows. Ignore for the moment all transaction costs
except the bid/ask spread in the bill market. The dollar value of the 5 basis point bid/ask spread
incurred in the interbank bill market is proportional to the term to maturity of the bill. The longer
the term to bill futures expiration, the longer the term of the bills traded in the bill market and the
greater the dollar transaction costs incurred in the bill market. An arbitrageur must recoup this cost
from mispricing in the bill futures contract. However, the dollar value of 1 basis point on the bill
futures contract is ﬁxed (if yield changes are ignored) since the underlying bill has a constant term
to maturity of 90 days. Thus the longer the term to bill futures expiration, the more the bill futures
yield must deviate from fair value for the arbitrageur to recoup his transaction costs.

bill opportunities. This finding is broadly similar to those reported in
studies of arbitrage in the foreign exchange and stock index futures
markets.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Institutional
details on the bill and bill futures markets are provided in Section 2.
Section 3 outlines the no-arbitrage pricing model for the bill futures
contract. The data sources are discussed in Section 4 and the methodology outlined in Section 5. The results are presented and discussed in
Section 6 and the paper is summarized in Section 7.
2. INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND
Bank bills are the most heavily traded instrument in New Zealand’s
short-term money market. Bank bills (or, more correctly, bank accepted
bills) are bills of exchange that have been accepted by a registered bank.5
The bills are often referred to as accommodation bills because they are
issued for the sole purpose of raising short-term funds for a corporate
borrower. The bills are drawn between a bank and a corporate borrower
with an acceptance facility and sold to investors in the primary market.
Bank bills have a minimum size of $50,000 and are issued with maturities between 7 and 365 days although the most popular maturities are
30, 60, and 90 days (Potter, 1995). Subsequent trading takes place in the
secondary market, a screen-based decentralised dealer market with trading hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In 1999 there were eight interbank
dealers acting as price-makers in the secondary market and one screen
broker facilitating transactions on behalf of dealers.6
The secondary market is divided into two segments, the wholesale
market and the retail market. The minimum size parcel in the wholesale
market is $1 million and the dealer’s bid/ask spread is typically 5 basis
points. In the wholesale market, interbank dealers buy and sell bills with
each other, large corporates and fund managers, both domestic and offshore, and other ﬁnancial institutions. In the retail market, retail dealers
buy and sell bills with small corporates and retail investors. The retail
dealer’s bid/ask spread is typically 10 basis points. Dealer quotes in both
the wholesale and retail markets are indicative only. That is, a dealer is
5

When a bank accepts a bill it undertakes to pay the face value of the bill to the holder on maturity date. Since the accepting bank will have a good credit rating the bill will trade at a small margin above Treasury bills with a similar term to maturity. This margin was 40 basis points in late
1999.
6
The eight dealers are ASB Bank, ABN AMRO, HSBC, ANZ Bank, BNZ, Deutsche Bank, National
Bank, and WestpacTrust. The screen broker is Fixed Interest Securities (NZ) Ltd.

not obligated to transact at the advertised quote. Individual dealer transactions are not reported to the market and there is little information on
the size of the bill market. Although data on trading volumes in the secondary market is not available, the volume of outstanding issues of bank
bills was estimated at $4 billion in 1994 (National Bank, 1994).
The NZFOE introduced the bank bill futures contract in December
1986 following dissatisfaction with the futures contract on prime commercial paper. The underlying ﬁnancial instrument is a bank bill with a
face value of $500,000 and a term to maturity of 90 days. The contract is
non-deliverable, that is, cash settlement is mandatory. The NZFOE
offers bank bill futures contracts with settlement months of March,
June, September, and December up to eight quarters ahead although
trading tends to be concentrated in the near contract.
The bank bill futures contract is the most successful derivative contract traded on the NZFOE. In 1998 turnover in the bank bill futures
contract amounted to 1,236,944 contracts for an average daily turnover
of $2,454 million. However, trading volumes declined during 1999 and
2000 following the sharp drop in day-to-day volatility in short-term interest rates that resulted from a change in how monetary policy was implemented in New Zealand in early 1999. Turnover fell 32.4% to 816,913
contracts in 1999, and this decline continued in the ﬁrst six months of
2000, albeit at a slower rate. By the end of the sample period in June
2000 turnover was running at an annual rate of 727,374 contracts.
The NZFOE is an automated market with a centralized electronic
limit order book. The trading hours for the bank bill futures contract
are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and overnight
from 7:00 p.m. to 7:10 a.m. Buy and sell orders are entered via terminals in the offices of brokers and transactions are governed by price
and time priority rules. Transactions occur when buy and sell orders
match. Transaction prices and volumes are reported immediately to the
market.

3. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT
3.1. No-Arbitrage Bill Futures Pricing
in the Absence of Transaction Costs
Arbitrage has been deﬁned as a strategy that “guarantees a positive payoff in some contingency with no possibility of a negative pay-off and
requires no net investment” (Dybvig & Ross, 1992). The no-arbitrage
pricing formula for the bill futures contract is based on the following

New Zealand Bank Bill Futures Market

assumptions: (a) m- and n-day bank bills (m  n) with a face value of $F
are traded in the bill market; (b) investors are indifferent between holding m- and n-day bills; (c) a bill futures contract with a maturity date of m
is available in the futures market. This contract is based on an n–m-day
bank bill with a face value of $F and a maturity date of n; (d) the daily
settlement-to-market feature of the bill futures contract is ignored;7 (e)
bank bills and bill futures contracts are perfectly divisible; and (f ) arbitrage is conducted by dealers employed by banks offering acceptance
facilities to borrowers.
In the absence of transaction costs and other frictions, the following
condition must hold if an arbitrage opportunity is not to exist:

Equation (1) deﬁnes the implied forward rate (IFR).
3.2. No-Arbitrage Bill Futures Pricing
in the Presence of Transaction Costs
3.2.1. Introduction
When transaction costs are non-zero, arbitrage opportunities will emerge
when the bill futures yield deviates from the IFR by more than enough to
compensate arbitrageurs for the transaction costs involved in structuring
an arbitrage trade. The transaction costs interbank arbitrageurs face
include: (a) the bid/ask spread on bill transactions of 5 basis points in the
interbank market; (b) a NZFOE fee of $2.50 per bill futures transaction;
(c) the interest cost on the initial margin payment of $600 per bill
futures contract;8 and (d) the market spread in the bill futures market,
which is usually between 1 and 2 basis points on the nearby bill futures
contract.9
7

Flesaker (1993) argued that treating the futures contract as if it were a forward contract by ignoring the settlement-to-market feature of the futures contract loses little accuracy. Although Cox,
Ingersoll, and Ross (1981) showed that the prices of otherwise equivalent forward and futures contracts differ according to the correlation between the price of the underlying asset and a stochastic
interest rate, Flesaker found the difference between the two yields to be quite small for contract
maturities less than one year. For instance, he reported the difference in yields is less than 0.2 basis
points on an annualized basis when the interest rate futures contract has a maturity of less than
3 months (see Flesaker, 1993, Table 1, p. 86).
8
The interest cost can be estimated by assuming arbitrageurs borrow at the m-day rate prevailing at
the time the bill futures position is established.
9
Brokerage fees are ignored since interbank arbitrageurs are assumed to have access to their inhouse futures desk.

This paper considers two arbitrage strategies, synthetic bill arbitrage and quasi-arbitrage.10 In a synthetic bill trade, an arbitrageur takes
advantage of any bill futures mispricing to enhance investment returns
by creating a synthetic bill. An arbitrageur with an n-day (m-day) investment horizon has a choice between purchasing an n-day bill (m-day bill)
or creating a synthetic n-day bill (m-day bill) by purchasing an m-day
bill (n-day bill) and taking a long (short) position in the nearby bill
futures contract. The synthetic bill is more attractive than a pure bill
when the promised yield net of transaction costs exceeds the promised
yield on the pure bill. The creation of a synthetic bill involves two transactions in the bill market and two transactions in the bill futures market
while the purchase of a pure bill involves only one transaction in the bill
market.11
Quasi-arbitrage involves either a cash-and-carry arbitrage or a
reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage trade. Under quasi-arbitrage, an arbitrageur takes advantage of any bill futures mispricing to earn a riskless
proﬁt by switching from a synthetic bill to a pure bill. If n-day (m-day)
yields are higher than warranted by yields prevailing in the bill and bill
futures market, the arbitrageur will purchase the n-day (m-day) bill by
selling m-day (n-day) bills and taking a short (long) position in the nearby
bill futures contract. If the transactions are structured correctly, the arbitrageur will be faced with zero cash ﬂows at times 0 and n and a positive
cash flow at time m. Arbitrageurs engaging in quasi-arbitrage conduct
three transactions in the bill market and two transactions in the bill
futures market.
3.2.2. Upper and Lower Bounds Under
Synthetic Bill Arbitrage
A synthetic n-day bill will offer a higher yield than a pure n day bill when
the bill futures best ask yield at time 0 exceeds an upper bound approximated by:

Pure arbitrage is ignored because short-selling of bank bills is not practiced in New Zealand.
Although synthetic bill arbitrage transactions do not satisfy the Dybvig and Ross (1992) criteria for
arbitrage, this paper follows convention and uses the term arbitrage to describe this type of trading
strategy.

The modiﬁed basis at time m represents the difference between either the bid or the ask yield on a
90-day bill and the settlement yield on the bill futures contract. The settlement yield is computed by
taking the average of the mid-quotes derived from bid and ask quotes on 90-day bills posted by dealers in the bill market. Since the bid/ask spread on a 90-day bill is typically 5 basis points, the modiﬁed
basis is 2.5 basis points. Although C varies with the level of yields, for all practical purposes it is constant. The exchange fee component of E is also constant but the interest foregone component varies
with the level of yields and the term to bill futures expiration. As a result C  E typically declines from
0.000088 90 days from bill futures expiration to 0.000070 one day prior to bill futures expiration.

3.2.4. When Is Arbitrage Not Arbitrage
and Does It Matter?
Kamara (1988) used the term “one-way arbitrage” to describe synthetic
bill arbitrage trades.13 As noted previously, this type of activity does not
satisfy the Dybvig and Ross (1992) criteria for arbitrage. Nonetheless,
the continuous ﬂow of investors seeking the highest yield should exert
equilibrating pressure on both bill and bill futures yields and eliminate
the synthetic bill arbitrage opportunity. It is also possible that synthetic
bill arbitrage activity may prevent quasi-arbitrage opportunities from
emerging. However, Rhee and Chang (1992) observed that one-way arbitrage opportunities do not give rise to a money machine because one-way
arbitrage trades are not initiated de novo in order to make money. The
arbitrageurs are in fact investors and once they have purchased either
their pure bill or synthetic bill, they exit the market. In contrast, quasiarbitrage or round-trip arbitrage opportunities attract arbitrageurs into
the market. Since these arbitrageurs will endeavor to establish large positions in both the bill and bill futures markets to generate riskless proﬁts,
the relatively higher level of arbitrage activity should eliminate any quasiarbitrage opportunity quickly. Whether synthetic bill arbitrage alone is
sufﬁcient to make conventional quasi-arbitrage redundant is ultimately
an empirical issue.
4. DATA
This paper uses intraday data from the bill futures and bill markets
for the period from 12 November 1999 to 14 June 2000. This period
spans the last 33 calendar days of the December 1999 bill futures contract and the last 91 calendar days of the March 2000 and June 2000 bill
futures contracts.
Reuters provided archived bid/ask quote data on 30-, 60-, 90-, 120-,
150-, and 180-day bank bills.14 Reuters compiled this data from indicative
13
This term originated in the literature on arbitrage in the foreign exchange markets. The traditional
argument is that covered interest arbitrage (or “round-trip arbitrage”) involving simultaneous
transactions in the spot and forward markets for foreign exchange and the domestic and foreign
securities markets ensures that the interest rate parity condition will hold. However, Deardorff
(1979) showed that the presence of arbitrageurs seeking the least-cost method of exchanging currencies should prevent exchange rates from ever departing enough from interest rate parity for conventional covered interest arbitrage to break even. Deardorff coined the phrase “one-way arbitrage”
to describe the activity of arbitrageurs with exogenous needs for foreign currency. Miller (1992)
used the terms “formal” and “informal” arbitrage to distinguish between arbitrage trading and “good
shopping by knowledgeable investors” in the stock and stock index futures markets.
14
The individual time series are referred to as Reuters Instrument Codes or RICs.

quotes posted by a panel of dealers operating in the interbank bill market.
The number of quote revisions over the sample period ranges from 426
for the 30-day bill to 1,823 for the more popular 90-day bill. Total quote
revisions over the six bill maturities amount to 5,814.
Reuters cautions that the quote data are a general guide to where
the market is and do not necessarily represent yields at which transactions are occurring. Reuters also provided archival data on the best bid
and best ask quote on the near bill futures contract. These quotes were
sourced from the electronic limit order book for the bill futures contract
on the NZFOE.
The literature recognizes two main problems with using Reuters
dealer quotes as proxies for transaction prices (e.g., Goodhart &
Figliuoli, 1991; Martens & Kofman, 1998). First, in an active market,
dealers may be too busy making deals to update their quotes. Second,
dealers may manipulate their quotes in an attempt to initiate a favorable market movement. A dealer can simply avoid being “hit” by not
answering the phone, by claiming that the quote is indicative rather
than ﬁrm or by agreeing to deal only in small amounts. On the other
hand, it can be argued that a dealer’s ability to refuse to trade at posted
quotes is to a large extent constrained by their need to maintain their
reputation and credibility with other market participants (e.g.,
Bollerslev & Domowitz, 1993; Goodhart & Figliuoli, 1991). Thus,
although these quotes (or even the mid-rate) do not represent actual
transaction prices, they provide a good approximation of prices at which
transactions are occurring.
Another potential problem is that of the nonsynchronicity of
bid/ask quotes from the bill market and transactions in the bill futures
market. Prior researchers examining index futures arbitrage recognize
that the infrequent trading of stocks within the market index can generate violations of no-arbitrage relations that are in fact spurious (e.g.,
MacKinlay & Ramaswamy, 1988). However, the particular nature of the
bill market quote data supplied by Reuters largely mitigates this potential problem. Speciﬁcally, Reuters only record changes in bid/ask quotes.
When a dealer changes his bid/ask quote for, say, the 90-day bill, the
new quote pair is compared to the 90-day quote in the broker market. If
the new quote pair is within a predetermined margin of the benchmark
quote in the broker market, Reuters records the new pair of quotes.
Thus, the absence of more recent quote pairs does not necessarily indicate that trading is not taking place, only that if trading is taking place,
it is taking place at the last recorded pair of quotes. This situation

529

530

Poskitt

differs from that of the stock market where transaction prices are the
primary source of trading information. In stock markets, the absence of
recent transaction prices on a stock signals that trading is not taking
place and that the prevailing price is stale. No similar presumption is
made in this study.
The NZFOE provided time-stamped transaction data on the bill
futures contract comprising time of trade to the nearest minute, price
and volume. Over the period from 12 November 1999 to 14 June 2000
there were 3,439 trades in the near bill futures contract for a total contract volume of 183,817 contracts. Some 272 of these transactions took
place during the overnight trading session and these are excluded from
the study. Furthermore, analysis of the Reuters quote data revealed that
bill quotes were missing on three days over the sample period: 26 and 29
November 1999 and 3 April 2000. Since newspaper reports indicated
that the bill market was open on these days, it was surmised that the
absence of quote data was due to technical problems experienced by
Reuters rather than to inactivity in the bill market. All bill futures transactions occurring on these days were therefore deleted from the sample.
Also, to prevent stale best bid and best ask quotes from inﬂuencing the
results, bill futures transactions taking place before Reuters recorded a
fresh bid or ask quote each morning were removed from the sample.15
Lastly, transactions taking place on the expiration dates of the nearby bill
futures contract (15 December 1999, 15 March 2000, and 14 June
2000) were removed from the sample. This left a ﬁnal sample of 3,019
bill futures transactions.

5. METHODOLOGY
Contract mispricing is measured by the bill futures/IFR differential at
the time of each bill futures transaction. The arithmetic bill futures/IFR
differential at time t is computed as follows:
rDiff,t  rtf  rtIFR

(6)

where r tf is the time t bill futures transaction yield and r tIFR the contemporaneous IFR. By convention, the differential is measured in both

Reuters does not record best bid and ask quotes arising from overnight trading in the bill futures
market. The best bid and best ask quotes prevailing when trading commences after 8:00 a.m. will
relate to trading on the previous afternoon. These quotes will not necessarily reﬂect where the bill
futures market is early in the morning session. Hence the need to remove these quotes from the
analysis.

arithmetic and absolute terms. The absolute bill futures/IFR differential
at time t is deﬁned as follows:
rAbDiff,t  ƒ rtf  rtIFR ƒ

(7)

For each bill futures transaction the contemporaneous IFR is
computed from the yield curve constructed from the most recent quotes
posted in the bill market. The IFR is computed using the following
equation:
rtIFR  c

1  (rt,n  n兾365)
1  (rt,m  m兾365)

 1d 

365
90

(8)

where rt,m and rt,n are the time t mid-quotes on m- and n-day bills respectively. Equation (8) shows that the forward rate for the period from time
m to time n is determined by the yields on m- and n-day bills (see, e.g.,
Hicks, 1939). When m and n are not multiples of 30, rt,m and rt,n are estimated by linear interpolation.16
Arbitrage opportunities occur when either the bill futures best ask
or best bid lies outside either the synthetic bill or quasi-arbitrage noarbitrage zones deﬁned earlier. The yield enhancements offered by synthetic bill arbitrage opportunities are computed by comparing the annualized yield on the synthetic bill, adjusted for transaction costs, with the
ask yield on the ordinary bill.
The annualized yield enhancements offered by the synthetic n- and
m-day bills are deﬁned by the following pair of equations:

Following Rendleman and Carabini (1979), let r and r denote the yield on bills maturing just
before and just after the maturity date of the d-day bill. Similarly, let d and d represent the days to
maturity of the corresponding bills maturing just before and just after the d-day bill. The yield on the
d-day bill is given by the following equation:

rd 

[r  (d   d)  r  (d  d  )]
d  d

Although dealers often use nonlinear methods to obtain yields on nonstandard maturities, the estimation error arising from the use of linear interpolation is not expected to be large since the interpolation interval is less than 30 days. The error is likely to be largest when d is less than 30 days
since these yields are extrapolated from the 30- and 60-day bill yields.

where r0,nm
and r0,nm
are the best ask and best bid quotes on the nearby bill futures contract. The term inside the square brackets on the RHS
of equation (9) represents the yield on the synthetic n-day bill and the
second term on the RHS is the yield on a pure n-day bill [refer to equations (1.2) and (1.3) in Appendix 1]. Similarly, the term inside the square
brackets on the RHS of equation (10) represents the yield on the synthetic m-day bill and the second term on the RHS is the yield on a pure
m-day bill (refer to equations (1.9) and (1.10) in Appendix 1).
Profits offered by quasi-arbitrage opportunities are computed by
assuming the m- and n-day bills and the 90-day bill underlying the bill
futures contract have a face value of $1 million. The proﬁts accruing to
reverse cash-and-carry and cash-and-carry trades are measured by the

6. RESULTS
6.1. The Futures/IFR Differential
Summary statistics on the arithmetic bill futures/IFR differential
are presented in Panel A of Table I for the full sample and for subsamples
based on the term to maturity of the nearby bill futures contract.
The frequency distribution of the arithmetic differential is depicted in
Figure 1.
The data in Panel A show that the mean differential is relatively
small and negative, at 2 basis points over the full sample. The mean
differential also narrows as bill futures maturity date approaches. The
Jarque–Bera statistics in Panel A indicate that the null hypothesis of normally distributed differentials is rejected except for the 0–30-day term to
maturity subsample. The nonparametric binomial Sign (S) and Wilcoxon
(T) statistics reported in Panel B indicate that the null hypothesis of a
zero median differential is rejected for the full sample and for each of the

term to maturity subsamples. These test results show that the IFR model
generates biased estimates of the bill futures yield.
The negative mean arithmetic differential for the sample implies
that the IFR model overprices the nearby futures contract. This ﬁnding is
consistent with results from previous studies (e.g., Capozza & Cornell,
1979; Lang & Rasche, 1978; Poole, 1978; Rendleman & Carabini, 1979;

Vignola & Dale, 1980). However, the overpricing is of doubtful economic
significance: two basis points is equivalent to approximately $24 on
$1 million face value of 90-day bills.17
The mean arithmetic differential compares favorably with those
documented in U.S. studies. For instance, Poole (1978) reported an
IFR-based mean differential for the nearby contract of 6 basis points.
Kawaller and Koch (1984) measured the differential in percentage terms
and report a mean differential of 0.31% for the IFR model but only
0.03% for the COC model. The mean percentage differential for the full
sample in this study is 0.31%.18 Overall, the results demonstrate that
the IFR model performs well in pricing the bill futures contract traded
on the NZFOE, consistent with the ﬁnding based on the use of closing
yield data (e.g., Poskitt, 1998).
The data in Table II show that the mean absolute differential is also
relatively small, at 3.3 basis points over the full sample. The mean
absolute differential for the full sample of 3.3 basis points compares very
favorably with those reported in U.S. studies. For example, Lang and
17

Differences between the creditworthiness of a bank bill and a bank bill futures contract could
drive a wedge between the IFR and the bill futures yield. However, it is difﬁcult to argue that credit
risk differences are responsible for such a small differential particularly when the credit risk differential between Treasury bills and bank accepted bills can be up to 40 basis points.
18
This ﬁgure is obtained by dividing 0.02% (2 basis points) by 6.52%, the mean bill futures transaction yield over the sample period.

New Zealand Bank Bill Futures Market

Rasche (1978) reported a mean absolute differential of 14 basis points
for the nearby bill futures contract.
The mean absolute differential is also increasing in the term to
maturity of the nearby bill futures contract, rising from 2.4 basis points
in the 1–30-day subsample to 4.2 basis points in the 61–90-day subsample. The Jarque–Bera statistics in Panel A indicate that the differentials
are nonnormal. The nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis (K) and median chisquare (x2) test statistics reported in Panel B show that the null hypothesis of equal median differentials across the three term to bill futures
maturity samples is strongly rejected. This result is consistent with the
positive relation between the width of the quasi-arbitrage no-arbitrage
zone and the term to maturity of the bill futures contract.19
6.2. Frequency of Ex Post
Arbitrage Opportunities
Table III documents the frequency of ex post synthetic bill and quasiarbitrage opportunities for the sample of bill futures transactions. Ex
post arbitrage opportunities exist when prevailing quotes in the bill and
bill futures markets are such that immediate execution at these quotes
will yield an arbitrage profit (Klemkosky & Lee, 1991). The sample is
stratiﬁed according to whether the bill futures yield is below or above the
IFR. Of the 3,019 bill futures transactions, 2,168 of the transaction
yields are below the IFR and the remaining 851 are above the IFR.
The results reported in Table III show that synthetic bill opportunities are more abundant than quasi-arbitrage opportunities.20 This
19

I also test for the impact of nonsynchronicity between bill market quotes and bill futures transactions on the absolute futures/IFR differential. If nonsynchronicity is important, then one would
expect the absolute futures/IFR differential to be increasing in the difference between the time of a
bill futures transaction and the time of the last recorded quote from the bill market. Following
Rendleman and Carabini (1979), the absolute futures/IFR differential is regressed against the time
difference variable. The coefﬁcient estimate of the latter is found to be negative but not signiﬁcantly
different from zero, with a t statistic of 1.07. When the lagged absolute differential is included as
an explanatory variable, the explanatory power of the model increases sharply but the coefﬁcient of
the time difference variable remains negative and is even less signiﬁcant. These results show that
the difference between the time of a bill futures transaction and the time of the last recorded quote
from the bill market has no signiﬁcant effect on the absolute futures/IFR differential. This ﬁnding is
consistent with the discussion in Section 4.
20
The results are broadly the same when arbitrage opportunities are assessed using bill futures yields
rather than best bid and best ask quote data. The number of cash-and-carry opportunities rises to 44
while the number of reverse cash-and-carry opportunities rises to 7. Overall, the incidence of quasiarbitrage opportunities rises to 1.5%. The number of synthetic m-day bill opportunities rises to 383
while the number of synthetic n-day bill opportunities rises to 812. Overall, the incidence of synthetic
bill opportunities rises to 38.7%. Mean yield enhancements barely change while mean proﬁts fall to
$42.99 and $59.36 for cash-and-carry and reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage opportunities respectively.

difference is more pronounced when the bill futures yield lies above the
IFR when the frequency of synthetic bill opportunities reaches 64.3%.21
The relatively high frequency of synthetic bill arbitrage opportunities
suggests that the ﬂow of investors into the markets seeking to enhance
yields is not sufﬁcient to prevent synthetic bill arbitrage opportunities
from emerging.
Table III shows that quasi-arbitrage opportunities are relatively
scarce, with incidences of reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage and cashand-carry arbitrage opportunities at 0.5% and 1.6% respectively. The
quasi-arbitrage opportunities are also highly clustered.22 At 1.3%, the
overall incidence of quasi-arbitrage opportunities is much lower than
the 17.3% incidence that Poskitt (1998) found using closing yield data.
The results in Table III compare favorably with those documented in
U.S. studies of quasi-arbitrage opportunities. For example, Lang and
Rasche (1978) reported the incidence of quasi-arbitrage opportunities at
40% while Hegde and Branch (1985) estimated the incidences at 9.3%
for reverse cash-and-carry quasi-arbitrage and 62.5% for cash-and-carry
quasi-arbitrage.
The incidence of ex post synthetic bill and quasi-arbitrage opportunities is also broadly comparable to the level documented by Rhee and
Chang (1992) for the foreign exchange market. They reported the incidence of one-way arbitrage opportunities for 1–3-month maturities in
21
The very high frequency of arbitrage opportunities in this situation largely reﬂects the low transaction costs incurred by arbitrageurs creating synthetic n-day bills: the gap between the IFR and
UB* is much smaller than the gap between the IFR and LB*. Thus, when the bill futures yield is
above the IFR it is also almost always above UB*.
22
Of the 34 cash-and-carry opportunities, 32 occurred on 17 April between 10:46 a.m. and 4:24 p.m.
and the remaining two occurred the following day at 4:20 p.m. and 4:22 p.m. Of the four reverse
cash-and-carry opportunities, three occurred between 8:58 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on 5 January and
the remaining one at 10:34 a.m. on 28 February.

the foreign exchange and eurocurrency markets at 47.3% for Sterling,
46.9% for the Deutschmark, 71.8% for the Swiss Franc, and 85.6% for
the Yen. In contrast, the authors found there were no covered interest (or
round-trip) arbitrage opportunities in the one to three month forward
maturities in the markets for Sterling, Deutschmarks and Swiss Francs,
and for Yen, the incidence was a mere 1.3%.
6.3. Economic Signiﬁcance of Ex Post
Arbitrage Opportunities
The beneﬁts of ex post synthetic bill opportunities are assessed in terms
of yield enhancements. Panels A and B of Table IV report the annualized
and nonannualized yield enhancements in basis points. The nonannualized data show that the majority of yield enhancements are small and less
than 0.5 basis points. When the yield enhancements are measured on
an annualized basis the dispersion in the yield enhancements increases,
with the impact more noticeable for m-day bills.23 The mean yield
enhancements rise to 2.9 basis points for synthetic m day bills and 1.3
basis points for synthetic n-day bills. These results suggest that, since
the bid/ask spread in the retail market is 5 basis points wider than in the

23
Part of the reason for the greater dispersion of annualized yields for m-day bills is that m is less
than n. The annualizing factor for m-day bills is 365/m while that for n-day bills is 365/n. Since m is
less than n, 365/m is greater than 365/n. Thus a given basis point yield differential between an ordinary bill and a synthetic bill will result in a greater annualized yield enhancement for an m-day bill
than an n-day bill.

537

Poskitt

interbank market, arbitrageurs without access to the interbank market
will rarely be able to take advantage of any bill futures mispricing to
enhance yields on their investments.
When the mean annualized yield enhancements of 2.9 and 1.3 basis
points are divided by the mean bill futures yield of 6.43%, the mean yield
enhancements are 0.45% and 0.20%. In comparison, Rhee and Chang
(1992) reported that one-way arbitrage of 1–3-month forward Sterling
yielded mean annualized percentage proﬁts of 0.06%, while similar activity in the Deutschmark, Swiss Franc, and Yen yielded proﬁts of 0.08%,
0.12%, and 0.15% respectively. Although the figures reported in this
study are larger, they are not an order of magnitude greater.
The gains from ex post quasi-arbitrage are assessed in terms of dollar
proﬁts per $1 million face value of bills. Table V reports the proﬁtability of
quasi-arbitrage opportunities on both a nonannualized and an annualized
basis. The data in Panel A of Table V shows that the proﬁtability of quasiarbitrage opportunities is relatively low with mean proﬁts of $51.80 and
$80.23 under cash-and-carry and reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage respectively. There are no instances where the quasi-arbitrage profit exceeds
$150 per $1 million face value of bills. An arbitrage proﬁt of $100 per $1
million face value of bills is equivalent to a percentage proﬁt of 0.01%!
The proﬁts available from ex post quasi-arbitrage opportunities are
lower than Poskitt (1998) ﬁnds and considerably lower than the corresponding ﬁgures that Elton et al. (1984) report. The latter study reported
mean profits of $1,351 per $1 million face value of bills for arbitrage
trades undertaken 90 days prior to bill futures maturity, declining to
$1,067 for trades undertaken 30 days prior to bill futures maturity. The

arbitrage opportunities identiﬁed in this study yield mean proﬁts equivalent to a few basis points. Given that Reuters quotes are only indicative,
the arbitrage proﬁts may well be illusory.
The generally low proﬁtability of ex post quasi-arbitrage opportunities documented above compares favorably with that found in studies of
arbitrage in stock /stock index futures markets. Lim (1992) reported a
mean percentage proﬁt of 0.12% (nonannualized) from arbitrage opportunities in the Nikkei stock index futures contracts. The corresponding
figure from Buhler and Kempf ’s (1995) study of arbitrage in the DAX
stock index futures contract is 0.42%, again on a nonannualized basis. In
contrast, the mean proﬁts reported above of $51.80 and $80.23 correspond to mean percentage proﬁts of 0.005% and 0.008% respectively!
Again, the data reported in Table V also suggests that the arbitrage
opportunities will not be available to arbitrageurs without access to the
interbank bill market.

6.4. Ex Ante Quasi-Arbitrage Opportunities
In an ex ante test of market efﬁciency, arbitrageurs attempt to make positive ex ante proﬁts upon observing ex post mispricing. The number of
proﬁtable quasi-arbitrage opportunities is expected to decline on an ex
ante basis because the proﬁt opportunity may disappear before the arbitrageur can execute his arbitrage trade. Ex ante proﬁtability is typically
assessed by assuming that arbitrageurs face delays in executing both the
futures and the cash market legs of an arbitrage transaction (e.g.,
Klemkosky & Lee, 1991).
Table VI reports the impact of delays in order execution ranging
from 1 minute to 10 minutes on the number and proﬁtability of quasiarbitrage arbitrage opportunities.24 The analysis underlying Table VI disregards arbitrage opportunities that occur within 10 minutes of an existing arbitrage opportunity. This leads to a sharp fall in the number of
arbitrage opportunities examined since most of the arbitrage opportunities occur in clusters. The small sample sizes make it difﬁcult to reject
the null hypotheses.
Execution delays reduce both the number of profitable arbitrage
opportunities and their average proﬁtability. For example, introducing a
1-min delay reduces the number of proﬁtable cash-and-carry arbitrage
24
Conversations with money market dealers suggest that a one minute delay is generous since all the
interbank dealer need do is buy or sell bills with the dealer offering the most favorable terms and signal the bill futures dealer to enter a market order into the NZFOE’s automated trading system.

trades from 12 to 10 and the mean proﬁtability from $47.42 to $39.25
per $1 million face value of bills. The impact of execution delays is more
muted for cash-and-carry trades. However, overall, neither the declines
in the success rate rates nor the declines in average proﬁtability are statistically signiﬁcant.
The decline in the number of proﬁtable arbitrage opportunities with
the passage of time is consistent with that documented in prior studies.
For example, Buhler and Kempf ’s (1995) study of arbitrage in DAX index
futures reported the success rate remaining at 100% after a 1-min delay
before declining to 99.8%, 98.2%, and 95.5% as the delay increased to 2,
5, and 10 minutes respectively. Chung’s (1991) study of arbitrage in MMI
futures finds the success rate under the 0.5% transaction cost regime
declining to 88%, 85%, and 83% with execution lags of 20 seconds, 2, and
5 minutes respectively.

7. SUMMARY
This paper examines pricing and arbitrage opportunities in the bill
futures contract traded on the NZFOE using an intraday data set. In
respect of contract pricing, the IFR model is found to yield biased estimates of the bill futures yield. The futures/IFR forward differential is
negative and signiﬁcantly different from zero. The tendency for the IFR
to overprice the bill futures contract is consistent with the results of
prior studies using the IFR model. However, the degree of overpricing, at
2 basis points, is small in comparison with that documented in prior
studies and of doubtful economic signiﬁcance. These results show that
the IFR model performs well in pricing the bill futures contract traded
on the NZFOE, consistent with prior research using daily data. In addition, the absolute futures/IFR differential is increasing in the term to
maturity of the bill futures contract, consistent with the notion that the
width of the quasi-arbitrage no-arbitrage zone is an increasing function
of the term to bill futures maturity.
The frequency of synthetic bill arbitrage opportunities is broadly
similar to that reported in prior studies but the yield enhancements are
minor. In contrast, quasi-arbitrage opportunities are very scarce compared to the levels reported in prior studies and the level of proﬁtability
markedly lower. Only rarely do arbitrage proﬁts exceed $100 per $1 million face value of bills. The absence of numerous and relatively proﬁtable
quasi-arbitrage opportunities suggests that the supply of quasi-arbitrage
services is sufﬁcient to ensure efﬁcient pricing. However, the relatively
greater abundance of synthetic bill opportunities suggests that the ﬂow
of investors seeking the highest yield is not strong enough to prevent synthetic bill opportunities from emerging.
The number of profitable quasi-arbitrage opportunities and their
average proﬁtability decline when execution delays are introduced but
the declines are not statistically signiﬁcant. However, analysis of execution risk is complicated by the small sample sizes.
In general, the gains to arbitrageurs are small, whether measured in
terms of yield enhancements or proﬁts. Moreover, it is extremely doubtful that these gains would be available to arbitrageurs not enjoying
access to the interbank bill market. It should also be remembered that
quotes in the interbank market are indicative, not ﬁrm, so any gains to
arbitrageurs may well be illusory. On the other hand, greater gains may
be available to arbitrageurs trading bills at broker bid/ask quotes which
are usually inside the bid/ask quotes of interbank dealers.

The frequency and profitability of arbitrage opportunities documented in this paper is broadly comparable to the levels reported in
studies examining arbitrage opportunities in stock index futures markets
and the international foreign exchange market. This shows the importance of using high frequency data to assess the transactional efﬁciency
of ﬁnancial markets.
APPENDIX 1: DERIVATION OF UPPER
AND LOWER BOUNDS FOR SYNTHETIC
BILL ARBITRAGE
Upper Bound
The upper bound for the bill futures ask yield is derived by considering
an arbitrageur with an n-day horizon who creates a synthetic n-day bill as
an alternative to purchasing an n-day bill.
At time 0 the arbitrageur simultaneously (a) buys m-day bills and
(b) buys one bill futures contract. At time m the m-day bills matured and
the arbitrageur simultaneously (a) invests the proceeds in an n–m-day
bill and (b) sells one bill futures contract. At time n the arbitrageur
receives the proceeds from the maturing n–m-day bill.
Let r bi, j denote the time i bid quote on a j-day bill and r ai, j the time i
ask quote on a j-day bill, C represent the modiﬁed basis at time m and E
represent the basis point equivalent of the sum of the NZFOE fee, brokerage fee, and interest foregone on the initial margin on a bill futures
transaction. Let P(r a0,n) be the time 0 price of the n-day bill at the ask
yield r a0,n, the time 0 price of the m-day bill at the yield and the time 0
price of the bill futures contract.
The transactions and resulting cash flows are summarized in
Table 1.1. The NZFOE fee, brokerage fee, and initial margin are all
assumed to be paid at time m.
Recall that C is the modiﬁed basis at time m. That is,
a

Substituting equation (1.1) into the net cash ﬂow at time m results
in a zero cash flow at this time. The yield on the synthetic n-day bill
strategy is therefore

APPENDIX 2: DERIVATION OF UPPER AND
LOWER BOUNDS FOR QUASI-ARBITRAGE
Upper Bound
The upper bound for the bill futures ask yield under quasi-arbitrage is
derived by considering an arbitrageur with an n-day horizon who initiates
reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage.
At time 0 the arbitrageur simultaneously (a) sells an n-day bill,25
(b) invests the proceeds in m-day bills, and (c) buys one bill futures contract. At time m the m-day bills mature and the arbitrageur simultaneously (a) invests the proceeds in an n–m-day bill and (b) sells one bill
25
It is implicitly assumed that the arbitrageur is an interbank dealer and that the bill has been issued
under a bill acceptance facility between the bank and a corporate client seeking funds. As the acceptor, the bank has primary liability for making payment of the face value of the bill on maturity date.

Including interest forgone on the initial margin payment automatically induces a positive term to
maturity effect into the width of the no-arbitrage zone since interest foregone is proportional to the
term to maturity.

Since time is incorporated into the width of the no-arbitrage zone
via m (the term to maturity of the m-day bill maturing on bill futures
expiration date) and n (the term to maturity of the n-day bill maturing 90
days after the maturity date of the short-term bill), the total differentiation approach is used.
This process is more manageable if the following substitutions are
made:

dZ*  0. Sample calculations show that this effect is minor.27 That is,
the width of the no-arbitrage zone is increasing in the term to maturity

Assume that m is 45 days and n is 135 days and that bid/ask yields are 6.00/5.95 for 45-day bill and

dZ*  0. That is, the term to maturity of the bill futures contract will not
have any effect on the width of the no-arbitrage zone. Lastly, if x  y
(i.e., the yield curve is downward-sloping), then dZ*  0. That is, an
increase in the term to maturity of the bill futures contract will reduce
the width of the no-arbitrage zone.
APPENDIX 4: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE WIDTH OF THE QUASI-ARBITRAGE
NO-ARBITRAGE ZONE AND THE TERM

The no-arbitrage zone for quasi-arbitrageurs, Z**, is deﬁned as

The sign of the total differential is inﬂuenced by the relative size of
v, w, x, and y. First consider the case of the upward-sloping yield curve
where v  w and x  y. Further assume the yield curve is steeply sloped
so the ask yield on the n-day bill exceeds the bid yield on the m-day bill,

that is, x  w. Since bid yields exceed ask yields, v  x and w  y. Under
these conditions:
(v  y)  0
(w  x)  0
2K(x  y)  0
2K(v  w)  0

(4.10)

K2 (w  x)  0
K2 (v  y)  0
where  indicates a positive difference larger than the preceding or following negative difference. Since the negative differences are outweighed by the positive differences the numerator in equation is positive.
That is, when dM  dN  0, dZ**  0 when the yield curve is steeply
upward-sloping.
Now consider the case of a ﬂat curve where v  w and x  y. Since
bid yields exceed ask yields, v  x and w  y. Under these conditions:
(v  y)  0
(w  x)  0
2K(x  y)  0
2K(v  w)  0

(4.11)

K2 (w  x)  0
K2 (v  y)  0
Therefore, when dM  dN  0, dZ**  0 when the yield curve is ﬂat.
Lastly, consider the case of the downward-sloping yield curve where
v  w and x  y. Further assume the yield curve is steeply sloped so the
ask yield on the m-day bill exceeds the bid yield on the n-day bill, that is,
y  v. Since bid yields exceed ask yields, v  x and w  y. Under these
conditions:
(v  y)  0
(w  x)  0
2K(x  y)  0
2K(v  w)  0
K2 (w  x)  0
K2 (v  y)  0

where  indicates a positive difference larger than the preceding or following negative difference. Although the third and fourth terms are negative, K is very close to zero so their impact is negligible. Since the negative differences are likely outweighed by the positive differences the
numerator in equation is positive. That is, when dM  dN  0, dZ**  0
when the yield curve is steeply downward-sloping.28

For example, assume that m is 45 days and n is 135 days and that bid/ask yields are 6.00/5.95 for all
bills. If K is $0.000070 for $1 of face value, then dZ** is 5.08 basis points when dm  dn  45 days.
That is, if the term to bill futures expiration increases by 45 days, the quasi-arbitrage no-arbitrage
zone will increase in width by 5.08 basis points when the yield curve is ﬂat. dZ** is slightly higher
when the yield curve is upward-sloping and fractionally lower when the yield curve is downwardsloping.
