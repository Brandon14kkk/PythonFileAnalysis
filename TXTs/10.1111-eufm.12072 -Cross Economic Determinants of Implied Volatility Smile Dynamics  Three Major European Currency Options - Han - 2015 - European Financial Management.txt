Abstract

This paper examines the contemporaneous and lead–lag relationships between
economic variables and implied volatility smiles for three major European
currency options. We ﬁnd that cross economic determinants are at least as
important as own economic variables in explaining the dynamics of implied
volatility smiles. Out-of-sample tests also suggest that cross economic variables
are important in predicting an economy’s currency option smile. These ﬁndings
suggest that the price impact from cross economic determinants may help ﬁll the
gap between the theoretical and the practical implied volatility skews.

1. Introduction

The relationship between asset returns and the real economy has been widely studied for
different ﬁnancial markets. Fama (1990) and Schwert (1990) ﬁnd that real stock returns
contain rich information about future production growth rates. Estrella and Mishkin

(1998) examine the out-of-sample performance of several ﬁnancial variables, including
stock prices, in predicting US recessions. Stock and Watson (1999, 2003) show that
asset prices can be used to forecast inﬂation and output. Hong and Yogo (2012) argue that
open interest of commodity futures is more informative about future economic activity
than futures prices. Welch and Goyal (2008) and Rapach et al. (2013) investigate the outof-sample predictability of real economic variables on equity premium. Beber and
Brandt (2006) examine the effect of macroeconomic news announcements on the
moments of risk-neutral state price densities extracted from bond options markets.
Ludvigson and Ng (2009) ﬁnd signiﬁcant predictive power of real activity for bond risk
premia.
This paper studies the cross asset–economy relationship, i.e., how asset prices in one
country or region may be affected by or contain predictive information about economic
variables in another country or region.1 Speciﬁcally, we examine the role of own, and in
particular cross, economic determinants on three major European currency option
implied–volatility–smile (IVS) dynamics. These options are over-the-counter (OTC)
options for euro (EUR), British pound (GBP) and Swiss franc (CHF), all quoted against
US dollars (USD). We address three questions. Which own and cross economic variables
are relevant to explain the contemporaneous dynamics of the three currency option IVS
dynamics? Are there any Granger causality relationships between each of these
economic variables and the currency option IVS dynamics? Are cross economic
variables important in the out-of-sample predictions of the currency option IVS
dynamics?
To answer these questions, we ﬁrst use the option price quotes, i.e., at-the-money
(ATM) volatility, risk reversal (RR) and butterﬂy spread (Bﬂy), to capture the
shape of the IVS. The ATM corresponds to the level of the smile curve, RR describes
the asymmetry of the curve and Bﬂy proxies the curvature of the curve. We further
propose that RR measures net speculative demand (NSD) and Bﬂy is a measure
of the gross hedging pressure (GHP) of the corresponding currency. The
economic determinants we consider are largely taken from the literature and can
be divided into three groups: variables from the foreign exchange market, from the
stock market and from the bond market. We use ordinary least squares (OLS)
regressions to test the contemporaneous correlations between curve characteristics
and own or cross economic variables, and then apply a multivariate autoregressive regression (VAR) analysis to examine their Granger-causality relationships.
Impulse response and variance decomposition analyses are conducted as robustness
checks.
We ﬁnd that cross economic variables are at least as, sometimes more, important
determinants of currency IVS dynamics than their own economic variables.
Contemporaneously, historical volatilities of currencies are positively associated with
ATM volatilities of other currencies. A negative spot rate return in one currency market
is accompanied by an increase in the ATM volatilities of other currencies. The

The economic variables studied in this paper are not strictly real economic activity proxies.
Rather, they are variables from the ﬁnancial markets. However, the literature of empirical
option pricing has termed them ‘economic determinants’ to differentiate these determinants
from the underlying asset characteristics. We use this term to keep consistency with this line
of research.

Switzerland stock market characteristics are closely associated with the RR and Bﬂy for
the pound and euro. And default risk in the euro bond market seems highly associated
with the implied volatilities of the Swiss franc and the pound.
The importance of cross economic variables is also shown in the Granger-causality
tests. For example, the historic volatility of the stock index in the euro area has predictive
power for the butterﬂy spread of the pound. The pound spot return Granger-causes the
risk reversal of all three options. The risk reversals of the euro and pound both positively
Granger-cause the spot rate trends of the other two currencies. Default spread does not
play any role in the Granger causality tests for butterﬂy spread and risk reversal but is
very important for ATM volatility. The ATM volatilities of the Swiss franc and the euro
Granger-cause the default spreads for all three economies. Both the impulse response and
variance decomposition analyses conﬁrm our ﬁndings. In particular, the variance
decomposition analysis, which explicitly quantiﬁes the magnitudes of contributions to
the forecast error variance of the smile dynamics of both own and cross economic
variables, ﬁnds a more signiﬁcant role played by cross economic variables. Because
previous studies claim that in-sample analyses may be unreliable due to over-ﬁtting
concerns, we also conduct out-of-sample tests to examine the predictive power of cross
economic variables. The results suggest that cross economic variables are at least as
important in predicting an economy’s currency option smile dynamics out-of-sample as
its own economic variables.
Why is a country’s currency option IVS dynamics signiﬁcantly determined by another
country’s economic variables? The unprecedented speed of economic and ﬁnancial
globalisation over the past few decades seems to be a plausible reason. Economic
interaction among different countries and regions has soared, and ﬁnancial markets
around the world have seen increased return correlations, volatility spillover and risk
contagion. Rizova (2010) shows that, in a two-country, Lucas-tree model with
information diffusion, returns in one country can predict returns in a trading partner
country. European economic integration is probably the most successful regional
integration so far in history and European Union countries trade heavily with each other
due to historical and geographical bonds among union members. Table 1 lists the top
trading partners for the three nations under consideration. For the UK, the European
Union dominates other countries and regions in both imports and exports, while
Switzerland is ranked 3rd in exports and 5th in imports. The EU and Switzerland are each
other’s major trading partners with over 50% (74%) of exports (imports) of Switzerland
going to (coming from) the EU. In theory, these close trade ties will facilitate information
diffusion across the three economies, leading to Granger-causal relationships between
their asset prices.
In addition, macroeconomists tend to agree that currency value is a good economic
indicator. If this is the case, then the progress of economic integration should strengthen
relationships between currency returns, consequently increasing the correlation between
currency option prices. In fact, as shown in Figure 1, the correlation between USD/EUR
and USD/CHF returns is as high as 72% (USD/EUR and USD/GBP is 65% while USD/
CHF and USD/GBP is 42%).
An alternative explanation is that, as pointed out in Rapach et al. (2013), information
diffuses from the market with the most investor attention to other markets. The three
currencies in this study are all among the most actively traded and most inﬂuential
currencies in the global foreign exchange market. Indeed, the euro is the major
alternative reserve currency after the US dollar, the Swiss franc is commonly perceived

by the market as a safe haven currency alongside the US dollar and Japanese yen, and the
pound is a traditionally strong currency outside the eurozone due to the size of the British
economy and the importance of London as a world ﬁnancial centre. Table 2 presents the
market turnover shares and rankings of major currencies (Panel A) and currency pairs
(Panel B). The euro, British pound and Swiss franc are constantly ranked 2nd, 4th and
6th, respectively, in terms of their share of the global foreign exchange market turnover.
The USD/EUR, USD/GBP and USD/CHF pairs are consistently among the top four
currency pairs. Hence new information starting from any one of these three economies
can diffuse to other economies, generating lead–lag relationships in their currency and
option prices.
This study ﬁlls a gap in the literature of empirical option pricing as almost nothing is
known about the own economic determinants of currency option implied volatilities, not
to mention the cross determinants, even though understanding this market is quite
important for both practitioners and academics because of the huge scale of the foreign
exchange market. More importantly, it extends existing studies of own economic

determinants of the implied volatility surface2 and sheds light on the option pricing
literature by revealing cross economic variables to be signiﬁcant contributors to the
shape of the implied volatility smile.3
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the summary statistics
of the data. Section 3 investigates and reports the contemporaneous and Granger
causality relationships between various economic variables and the three major currency
option volatility smiles. An out-of-sample analysis is also conducted. Section 4
concludes.

Pena et al. (1999) are the ﬁrst to study this line of thought. Using the IBEX-35 Spanish index
options, they ﬁnd that transaction costs and market conditions, such as the volatility of the
underlying and market momentum are key factors driving implied volatility function shapes.
Mixon (2002) links economic variables to the principal components of the S&P 500 index
implied volatility surface and demonstrates the importance of short-term interest rates and
credit spread in modelling implied volatility. Deuskar et al. (2008) explore the economic
determinants of Euro interest rate caps and ﬂoors and ﬁnd that the spot rate, the slope of the
yield curve and the cost of liquidity in the options market are relevant for determining the
implied volatility surface. Different from these studies, we focus on how information from
economic variables in one country helps explain the variation of the option smile dynamics
for another currency.

The papers by Krylova et al. (2009) and Nikkinen et al. (2006) use similar samples as this
study; however, they do not address the question of what are the economic determinants of
the entire IVS shape.

2. Data

2.1. Data and descriptions
We obtain, from one of the major dealers in the OTC currency options market, daily
middle price quotes from January 2000 to June 2012 for three one-year-maturity currency
options including EUR (quoted in US dollars per euro), CHF (quoted in Swiss francs per
US dollar) and GBP (quoted in US dollars per British pound). By convention, currency
option prices with different deltas are quoted by the corresponding ATM, RR and Bﬂy
values. A 25 delta RR and Bﬂy, for example, are deﬁned as in the following equations:
RR ¼ s þ  s 

ð1Þ

Bf ly ¼ ðs þ þ s  Þ=2  s 0

ð2Þ

where s0 is the ATM implied volatility, sþ is the implied volatility of the 25 delta
call and s_ is the implied volatility of the 25 delta put. The 25 delta put is the put
whose strike has been chosen such that the delta is –25%. Quotes for other deltas are
deﬁned similarly.

There is a big variation in the number of quotes on any particular transaction day for a
certain type of currency pair. Table 3 presents the data structure of the quotes for all
currency pairs from January 2000 to June 2012. ATM implied volatilities, the 25 delta
RR and the Bﬂy are always quoted; however most 10 delta and 15 delta RR and Bﬂy
quotes do not appear until July 2007. For this reason, the sample we use primarily
consists of the 25 delta RR and Bﬂy quotes of the three currency options. Adding the
other deltas does not change our results signiﬁcantly.

Graphically, the ATM implied volatility captures the level, the risk reversal corresponds
to the skewness and the butterﬂy spread captures the curvature, of the option implied

volatility smile curve. While ATM volatility is well known as a proxy of market
uncertainty, the economic meanings of risk reversal and butterﬂy spread are not well
discussed. Here we reinterpret these two concepts in an economically meaningful way so
studying their correlations across the three currency options markets makes economic
sense.
Recent empirical option pricing literature (see, for example, Bollen and Whaley, 2004;
Chan et al., 2004; Garleanu et al., 2009) reaches a consensus that net hedging pressure is a
major factor in explaining the shape and dynamic of the implied volatility curve. The idea
is that, given limits to arbitrage, the option supply curve should be upward sloping instead
of a horizontal line, so net demand for options positively affects option prices. In particular,
Garleanu et al. (2009) document that the implied volatility skewness for index options is
mainly driven by net hedging pressure from out-of-money (OTM) puts. On the other hand,
investors tend to buy cheap OTM calls to speculate on future price increases. So, loosely
speaking, for any option, the left slope of the implied volatility curve measures hedging
pressure, while the right slope reﬂects speculative demand for the underlying asset.
We now extend these explanations to the currency options case. Unlike index options,
currency options tend to smile, not smirk. So the shape of a currency option implied
volatility curve can be clearly decomposed into two parts: the left slope and the right
slope. Take USD/EUR as an illustration. From the discussion above, the right slope of the
option smile curve reﬂects the speculative demand for euro appreciation, while the left
slope, loosely corresponding to the right slope of an imaginary EUR/USD smile curve,
captures the speculative demand for dollar appreciation (euro depreciation). Hence risk
reversal, as the difference between the left and right slopes, is a proxy of net speculative
demand (NSD) for the euro.
From the hedging pressure perspective, the left slope of the option smile curve can be
attributed to the net hedging pressure for euro depreciation insurance, while the right
slope, corresponding to the left slope of an imaginary volatility curve for the EUR/USD
pair, can be interpreted as the hedging pressure for dollar depreciation. So this butterﬂy
spread, as the sum of the left and the right slopes, is a measurement of the gross hedging
pressure (GHP) for both currencies.
Figure 2 shows the time series of the 25 delta ATM, RR and Bﬂy of the three options.
We make several observations. First, it is clear that in the ﬁrst period from January 2000
to November 2007, for all three options, the implied volatility curves exhibit a low level
of variation; in the second period from November 2007 to June 2012 they become more
volatile. This is possibly due to both increasing speculative and hedging needs through
the OTC trading of currency options after the recent global ﬁnancial crisis. In the
following analysis, we focus on the second period as it spans both the global ﬁnancial
crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. The full sample is adopted as a robustness
check. Second, our three major variables, ATM, RR and Bﬂy, reﬂect market uncertainty,
NSD and GHP. Both market uncertainty and GHP increase as the sovereign debt crisis
develops. For example, they jump to their highest levels when Iceland’s debt crisis
emerges at the end of 2008. Then they decrease only to increase again when Greece takes
central stage in the debt crisis in early 2010. The last two spikes occur when the crisis
spreads to Portugal and Spain in late 2011 and then to Europe as a whole in early 2012.
On the other hand, RR, as a proxy of NSD for currencies, exhibits a decreasing trend
during the sample period. Before the global ﬁnancial crisis it ﬂuctuates around zero, in
general, but after the crisis, and with the deepening of the European debt crisis, it
becomes very negative, suggesting a dampening of the desire for speculation. Third, the

three volatility curves tend to move together in general,4 with some leads and lags,
suggesting that some common economic determinants of the option prices exist.
2.3. The implied volatility surface for three currency options
Before we move on to examine the economic determinants of currency options, we take a
direct look at the IVS of these options. From equations (3) and (4), given a set of ATM,
RR and Bﬂy quotes, we can derive the implied volatilities of puts and calls with their
corresponding deltas using the following formula:
1
s þ ¼ ATM þ BF þ RR
2

ð3Þ

1
s  ¼ ATM þ BF  RR :
2

ð4Þ

We then apply the Garman–Kohlhagen model to calculate the corresponding moneyness
as the ratio of the strike price to the spot exchange rate for each day.
As shown in Table 3, for some transaction days in the early part of the sample, certain
types of quotes do not exist; so we can only get a limited number of points (si,(K/S)i) to
compute the volatility smile. To take the missing points into consideration, we apply a
polynomial interpolation to get a smooth volatility smile on every transaction day.
Figure 3 shows the IVS for each option series during the sample period. On most
transaction days, the implied volatility curve displays a smile shape for all options.
Consistent with Figure 2, we observe a sharp lift of the surface around late 2007, and in
the second period the smiles appear to be much steeper than in the ﬁrst period.
2.4. Implied volatility function for the three option IVS
In this section, we carry out statistical tests on the smile curves of the three option
series by ﬁtting a quadratic functional form of moneyness to the implied volatilities.
This form has been widely used in existing studies such as Pena et al. (1999) and
Deuskar et al. (2008):
IV ¼ a1 þ a2  Moneyness þ a3  Moneyness2 :

ð5Þ

For each day in the sample, we run this regression equation to estimate the coefﬁcients
for each currency option series. We then calculate the time series average of these
estimated coefﬁcients for the whole sample and the two subsamples. Table 4 presents the
estimation results. All the average coefﬁcient estimates are statistically different from
zero and have expected signs, consistent with the assumption that currency options
smile, and do not smirk.
To visualise this, Figure 4 plots the ﬁtted implied volatility function for the three
options based on the averages of the above estimates. Consistent with our earlier

observations, on average the smile curves in the second subsample are higher and are
more curved than those in the ﬁrst subsample. There also exist clear asymmetries in the
shape of the smiles with the left slope steeper than the right. This is more so for the British
pound and euro smiles and for those in the second subsample.

3.1. The contemporaneous relationship
As mentioned in the introduction, the ATM, RR and Bﬂy measures can capture the shape
of an option smile. So we regress them on a set of economic variables to determine the
relevant economic determinants.
Our ﬁrst group of independent variables is related to the spot market, and includes the
exchange rate return (FX Return), return trend (FX Trend) and historical return volatility
(FX Hisvol). The exchange rate return is computed as the daily log return of the currency.
The return trend is calculated as the difference between the log exchange rate of today
and that of 30 days ago. If the exchange rates are mean-reverting, then low exchange
rates are likely to be followed by exchange rate increases which may be reﬂected in a
high demand for out-of-money calls, thus inﬂuencing the shape of the volatility smile.
Historical volatility is calculated as the volatility of currency returns in the past 90 days
and is commonly perceived as a measurement of uncertainty of the spot rate market.
When market uncertainty goes up, the demand for out-of-money calls and out-of-money
puts will increase. As a result, the hedging pressures for the euro and US dollar will both
increase and lead to a more curved smile. Exchange rates data are obtained from Wharton
Research Data Services.
Our second group of candidate economic determinants contains variables related to
the stock market including index trend (Index Trend) and historic volatility of index
returns (Index Hisvol). Index Trend is calculated as the log difference between today’s
market index and that of 100 days ago. We choose FTSE 100, SMI and STOXX50E as
the market indexes for the UK, Switzerland and the Eurozone, respectively. As a
barometer of the economy, a downward stock market may indicate a weakened economy
from which yield-chasing capital tends to ﬂee, so its exchange rate will be under pressure
to depreciate, leading to higher demand for out-of-money put protection. Return historic
volatility is calculated as the standard deviation of the market index return for the past
90 days. When uncertainty rises, currency hedging demand should increase, and so will
the curvature of the option IVS. Market index data are downloaded from Yahoo Finance.
In our last group of independent variables, we include default spread (Default Spread)
as the yield difference between each economy’s 10 year government bond and the US
10-year Treasury note. For EUR, we take the averages of all eurozone countries’ 10 year
government bond yields, provided by European Central Bank, as a proxy of the
government bond rate. The data for the government bond yields in the UK, Switzerland
and US are from the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis, respectively. We incorporate this variable because it reﬂects
the probability of default and a spread increase may lead to capital outﬂow from the
economy, as was observed in the recent European sovereign debt crisis. As a result,
demand for out-of-money put protection will increase.
Table 5 reports the summary statistics of all variables in the subsequent regression
analyses. The means of RR for all currencies are negative,5 suggesting that average
investors use these currency options to hedge rather than speculate during this period. On
average, the Swiss franc charges a negative default risk premium relative to the US
dollar, consistent with its status as a safe haven currency. The means of the exchange rate
return and trend for the three currencies are all negative, indicating a decreasing trend for
the three currencies in our sample period.

Table 5
Summary statistics of the dependent and independent variables
This table presents the summary statistics for all the variables of interest from 12th November, 2007 to
1st June, 2012. The default spread of one economy is caculated as the difference between that
economy’s 10 year government bond and that of the US Treasury bond. Index Trend is calculated as the
difference between the spot log market index of today and that of 100 days ago. Index Hisvol refers to
the volatility of the market index return for the past 90 days. FX Return refers to the daily log return. FX
Trend is calculated as the difference between today’s spot log exchange rate and that of 30 days ago. FX
Hisvol is calculated as the volatility of the currency return in the past 90 days. RR, Bﬂy and ATM refer
to the butterﬂy spread, risk reversal and at-the-money volatility of the FX option, respectively. FX
Return, FX Trend and FX Hisvol are based on data from Wharton Research Data Services. Index Trend
and Index Hisvol are from Yahoo Finance. Default Spread Fr, Default Spread £ and Default Spread s

The regression speciﬁcations are as follows.6 For some time series of variables that are
I(1), we take their ﬁrst-order differences to ensure that all the variables used in the
regressions are stationary. Each regression includes an AR(1) error term to correct for
serial correlations.

where IVSi denotes either Bﬂy, RR or ATM and i and j stands for the three currencies. We
run 3  3 ¼ 9 regressions in total. Since there are many candidate predictor variables, we
apply stepwise regressions to extract the best subsets of regressions to ensure that the
ﬁnal models are more concise yet retain good explanatory power.
Rapach et al. (2013) ﬁnd that lagged US returns signiﬁcantly predict returns in many
non-US industrialised countries, suggesting the leading role of the US stock market as a
common factor for global asset returns. Longstaff et al. (2011) study the sovereign CDS
markets and show that the US equity, volatility and bond market risk premia are
predictive of a signiﬁcant amount of variation in sovereign credit returns. Our focus in
this paper is volatility rather than return, and the volatility spillover from the US is shown
to be weak in economic terms according to Christiansen (2007). However, to separate out
cleanly the within-Europe effect from the global effect, we still control for the US factors
in regression (6). Speciﬁcally, we use the VIX and MOVE, implied volatility indices of
US stock and Treasury bond yield, which are used in Zhou (2014), as control variables.
Table 6 reports the regression results. We ﬁrst check the effect of own economic
variables on the shape of the smiles. Consistent with the notion that butterﬂy spread
measures GHP, for both the pound and euro, Bﬂy is negatively associated with their own
stock market trend. This notion is also evidenced in that, for all three currencies, Bﬂy is
positively associated with the historic volatility of each currency’s spot rate returns.
Default spread is a positive determinant of the Swiss franc, but not for the other two
currencies.
The results presented in Panel B indicate that both euro and pound risk reversals are
positively associated with their own stock market trend, suggesting that a rising stock
market induces investors to speculate on currency appreciation. Similar observations can
be made for currency spot returns. In sharp contrast with the Bﬂy case, for each option,
RR is not signiﬁcantly related to stock market volatility. Default spread is an important
determinant for the euro, possibly because an increase in default probability leads
investors to speculate on euro depreciation.
In Panel C we ﬁnd a positive relationship between ATM implied volatility and the
historic volatilities of spot rate returns and stock market returns. This is intuitive as they
both measure market uncertainty in the market except that implied volatility is forwardlooking while historical volatility is backward-looking. In addition, the spot rate return is
negatively associated with its own ATM volatility for all options, consistent with the
6

To lessen the bias due to extreme outliers and for ease of interpretation of results, in the
following analyses all variables are standardised by subtracting the mean and then dividing
the result by the standard deviation.

well-documented negative return-volatility relationship for equities. Default spread is
signiﬁcantly associated with ATM volatility in the eurozone.
Now we turn to the inﬂuence of cross economic determinants. From Panel A, the
historical volatility of the Swiss stock market is positively associated with Bﬂy or the GHP
of the other two currencies. In addition, Panel B shows that uncertainty in the Swiss stock
market is negatively associated with RR or the speculative demand for the other two
currencies. In comparison, however, uncertainties in the British and eurozone stock
markets are not related to speculation or hedging pressure on the Swiss franc. These
observations are consistent with the market recognition of the Swiss franc as a safe
currency.
The spot rate return of one currency is highly related to speculations on other
currencies. For example, the spot rate return of the pound is positively related to
speculation on the Swiss franc with a signiﬁcant coefﬁcient of 0.146. Cross economic
variables also play a signiﬁcant role in ATM volatility, as shown in Panel C. In general,
historical volatilities of currencies are positively associated with ATM volatilities of
other currencies. Similarly, a negative spot rate return in one currency market tends to
drive up the ATM volatilities of other currencies.
An increase in the default risk in the eurozone bond market is positively associated with
the ATM volatilities of the Swiss franc and the pound. However, default risk in Swiss and
British bond markets is not cross related to the implied volatilities of other currencies. This
central role played by the euro has probably been best illustrated in the recent European
Sovereign debt crisis. As the default probability of the eurozone increases, fear not only
boosts uncertainty in the euro options market, but also spreads to the other two markets.
Finally, it is worth noting that the two US variables, VIX and MOVE, have signiﬁcant
explanatory power on the smile dynamics. VIX is positively assotiated with the Bﬂy and
ATM for all currency options, consistent with the volatility spillover effect documented
in the literature. MOVE is positively related to the ATM volatility for all currencies, and
negatively correlated with the RR of the pound and euro.
To summarise, we ﬁnd some interesting contemporaneous interactions between own
and cross economic variables and the option smiles of these three currencies. The stock
market performance of Switzerland is closely related to the speculation and hedging
demand for the pound and the euro. And default risk in the euro bond market is highly
associated with the implied volatilities of the Swiss franc and the pound.
3.2. The lead–lag relationships
In this section, we uncover the lead–lag relationships between the candidate economic
variables and the shape of the volatility smiles. We apply a multivariate vector
autoregressive regression (VAR) model to calculate the ATM, RR and Bﬂy of the three
currency options, and include all the economic variables in the previous section as
explanatory variables.7 Since some of the variables are non-stationary, we take their ﬁrstorder differences to ensure their stationarity. The number of lags is automatically chosen
according to the HQ criterion.
7

A recent advance in causality analysis is the directed acyclic graphs (DAG) model. This
technique has been used in Yang and Zhou (2013) to study the credit risk spillover among
ﬁnancial institutions. However, we believe that a regular multivariate VAR model is
sufﬁcient for our purposes.

3.2.1. Granger causality tests. Panel A of Table 7 presents the p-values for testing the
null hypothesis that economic variables do not Granger-cause the butterﬂy spread by
testing whether the coefﬁcients of the lag terms of the economic variables are jointly
zero. Panel B reports the results for testing the contra. Of note is that many fewer lead–lag
relationships exist between the butterﬂy spread and economic variables compared with
the contemporaneous results.
There are several exceptions. First, the Bﬂy or the market GHP on the pound can
Granger-cause the movement of its own spot rate return, trend and volatility. Second,
historical volatility for Swiss index returns can predict the future value of its own butterﬂy
spread. And the historic volatility of the stock index in the eurozone has predictive power
for the butterﬂy spread of the pound, although they have no contemporaneous relationships.
Panel A of Table 8 shows a different picture. There are more Granger-causality
relationships between RR and its own and cross economic variables. For example, the euro
spot return Granger-causes the RR of its own and that of the Swiss franc. The pound spot
return Granger-causes the RR of all three options. In contrast with the contemporaneous
tests, default spread does not have predictive information about risk reversal.
Risk reversal Granger-causes many economic variables. As shown in Panel B of
Table 8, the risk reversals of the euro and pound both positively Granger-cause the spot
rate returns and trends of the other two currencies, suggesting that currency speculations
may spread to spot markets in other economies. Cross lead–lag relationships are also
observed between risk reversal and stock market characteristics.
Although we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant contemporaneous relationship between ATM volatility
and the historic volatility of the spot rate return or the stock index return, based on results
in Panel A of Table 9, we fail to reject most of the hypotheses that no lead–lag
relationships exist between these variables. Neither can any other economic variables
Granger-cause ATM volatility. However, from Panel B, ATM volatility contains
important predictive information about the future default spread as evidenced by the
ATM volatilities of the Swiss franc and the euro both Granger-causing the default
spreads for all three economies. This again highlights the informational importance of
euro and Swiss franc option prices.
It is also interesting to note that the ATM volatilities of the three European currency
options Granger-causes changes of MOVE, implied volatility extracted from the US
bond market.
3.2.2. Impulse response analysis. We now present in Figure 4 the impulse response
analysis results based on the VAR model, standardised by Cholesky decomposition, to
determine the persistence of any impact. Since the Cholesky decomposition is sensitive
to the ordering of the VAR, we choose the order according to the Wold causal ordering,
i.e., we order the VAR from the most exogenous variable to the most endogenous one
based on the results of the Granger causality.8 For brevity we only present results for
selected cases. Results for other cases are consistent with the Granger causality test
results and are available upon request.
Panel A of Figure 5 demonstrates the response of the butterﬂy spread of the Swiss
franc to a one Cholesky standard deviation shock to the Swiss index’s historic volatility.

The results of the impulse response function are robust to changes in variable ordering in the
VAR model.

Cross Economic Determinants of Implied Volatility Smile Dynamics

845

A positive shock initially increases its own butterﬂy spread with the effect quickly
disappearing after about 1 day, suggesting that stock market uncertainty has only a
temporary impact on the GHP for its own currency. Similarly, as shown in Panel B, a
positive shock to the spot rate return of the euro increases its own RR for 1 day, possibly
because investors speculate that the exchange rate will continue to go up next day in a
strong spot market.
Panel C of Figure 5 shows the response of RR of the Swiss franc to a one Cholesky
standard deviation shock to the exchange rate return of the euro. There is an initial
increase in the RR of the Swiss franc which reverts back the next day, implying that a
strong euro can have a short-term impact on the speculative demand for the Swiss franc.
The same pattern of impulse response is exhibited in Panel D for the shock of the stock
index volatility in the eurozone to the butterﬂy spread of the British pound.
3.2.3. Variance decomposition. As further checks, Tables 10 to 12 report the results of
variance decomposition on the butterﬂy spread, risk reversal and at-the-money volatility
of the three options, respectively. The variance decomposition method helps us discern
the contribution of each economic variable to the forecast errors for the shape of the
volatility smile.
Contributions from cross economic variables are shaded gray in the Tables 10 to 12. It
is clear that regardless of variable, the proportions from cross economic variables are at
least as large as those from own economic determinants. For example, as shown in
Table 10, the dominant economic variable for explaining the 10-day forecast error
variance of the pound’s butterﬂy spread is the historical volatility of the eurozone stock
index, followed by the Euro spot return and the Switzerland stock index trend. Another
striking example is illustrated in Panel B of Table 11 for the pound’s risk reversal.
Economic variables from the Swiss franc and euro together take a much larger proportion
than do those from the pound itself in explaining the forecast error variance of the
pound’s risk reversal. In contrast, the two US variables, VIX and MOVE, play less
important roles in explaining the forecast error variance of their European currency
option smiles. Similar observations can be made for almost all currency smile
characteristics. For robustness checks, we also do a variance decomposition for 5-day
and 20-day ahead and ﬁnd quite similar results (available upon request), suggesting that
the contributions from cross economic variables are stable over the forecasting horizon.
Overall, these results demonstrate quantitatively that the effect of cross economic
determinants are at least as sensitive as for own variables in explaining the implied
volatility smile dynamics.
To summarise, in this section we ﬁnd signiﬁcant own and cross causality relationships
among the economic variables and volatility smiles, in particular the RR and ATM
implied volatility. Risk reversal can Granger-cause many economic variables. Spot rate
return can Granger-cause risk reversal, or equivalently, can change the symmetry of the
volatility smile and inﬂuence NSD. The historical volatility of the spot rate return is
important for contemporaneous relationships, but not so for lead–lag relationships.
Default spread does not play any role in the Granger causality tests for the Bﬂy and RR,
but it is very important for ATM volatility. Both the impulse response and variance
decomposition analyses conﬁrm our ﬁndings.
3.2.4. Out-of-sample tests. The above in-sample analyses point to Granger-causality
effect between cross countries’ economic variables and option prices. However, many

studies have cast doubt on the reliability of in-sample results, as there may be an overﬁtting issue, and have suggested the use of out-of-sample tests to check the results for
robustness. In this section, we adopt the Campbell and Thompson (2008) out-of-sample
statistics approach, which measures the proportional reduction in mean squared forecast
errors for predicted option smile dynamics by random walk relative to a competing
model that uses cross economic variables. Rapach et al. (2013) adopt similar approach to
test the out-of-sample predictability of lagged US stock returns. Speciﬁcally, we test the
model:

for i; j 2 fCHF; GBP; EURg, i 6¼ j and k 2 fRR; ATM; Bf lyg. The benchmark model
is imposed by restrictions by b1j;i;k;t ¼ b2j;i;k;t ¼ . . . ¼ b8j;i;k;t ¼ 0. Pooled estimates impose
the restriction that bnj;i;k;t ¼ bni;k;t ¼ 0 for n ¼ 1, 2,. . ., 8 and aj;i;k;t ¼ ai;k;t in the
benchmark model, bnj;i;t ¼ bni;t for n ¼ 1, 2,. . ., 8 and aj;i;k;t ¼ ai;k;t in the competing
model. The initial in-sample data are from 12th November, 2007 to 29th March, 2010
and then constructed by rolling windows.
Table 13 reports the out-of-sample test results. In parentheses are the Clark and West
(2007) MSFE-adjusted statistic to test H 0 : R2OS ¼ 0 against H 1 : R2OS > 0, where ROS is

, where MSFERW and MSFECEV represent mean squared

forecast errors by historical means (the random walk model) and cross economic
variables, respectively. Four out of eight statistically signiﬁcant ROS are positive,
indicating that, in some cases, cross economic variables have better out-of-sample
predictive power on an economy’s currency option price dynamics than the random walk
model. Speciﬁcally, compared to the random walk model, using European economic
variables performs signiﬁcantly better in predicting the other two currencies’ Bﬂy
spread, Switzerland economic variables forecast the euro Bﬂy spread better, and using
the British economic variables shows better forecastability for the Swiss franc Bﬂy
spread. Pooled prediction regression results lead to similar conclusions. It is worth noting
that, while in previous sections we document a signiﬁcant cross effect for IVS
characteristics with most effects on risk reversals and ATM volatilities, here all the
signiﬁcant predictions are with butterﬂy spreads, not with risk reversals, nor ATM
volatilities. This highlights the difference between the in-the-sample tests and the out-ofsample tests.
4. Conclusion

This study ﬁnds signiﬁcant contemporaneous and lead–lag relationships between own
and cross economic variables and the dynamics of three major European currency option
smiles. Contemporaneously, default spread, own and cross spot rate return, spot market
trend, and historical volatility in the stock and spot markets are all important contributors
to the time series variation of implied volatility smiles. The stock market situation in
Switzerland is signiﬁcantly associated with the GHP on the euro and pound, but not the
other way round. The spot rate return is positively connected to speculation forces on the

other currencies. Volatility spillovers exist across economies and a higher default risk in
the euro bond market is associated with higher implied volatilities of the Swiss franc and
pound, but not the other way round.
The curvature of the IVS, as captured by the butterﬂy spread, seems to have very few
lead–lag relationships with economic variables, whether own or cross economic

determinants. The slope of the IVS, i.e., the risk reversal, Granger-causes and is Grangercaused by many own and cross economic determinants. The level of the IVS, or the ATM
volatility, of the Swiss franc or euro Granger-causes the default spread of all economies.
A following variance decomposition analysis shows that cross economic determinants
contribute more than own economic variables to the variation of future IVS dynamics.
Our out-of-sample tests further conﬁrm the important role of cross economic
determinants.
These ﬁndings are explained by the three countries’ close economic ties, and their
market shares in the global foreign exchange market. The lead–lag relationships
identiﬁed in this study are consistent with the gradual information diffusion story.
Taken together, these results suggest that, in developing an option pricing model to
explain the steepness of the implied volatility curve, it is beneﬁcial to keep in mind of
economic determinants from other economies as globalisation has made economies in
the world more integrated than ever before.
