This paper uses intra-day data for the period 2002 through 2008 to examine the intensity, direction, and
speed of impact of US macroeconomic news announcements on the return, volatility and trading volume
of three important commodities – gold, silver and copper futures. We ﬁnd that the response of metal
futures to economic news surprises is both swift and signiﬁcant, with the 8:30 am set of announcements
– in particular, nonfarm payrolls and durable goods orders – having the largest impact. Furthermore,
announcements that reﬂect an unexpected improvement in the economy tend to have a negative impact
on gold and silver prices; however, they tend to have a positive effect on copper prices. In comparison,
realized volatility and volume for all three metals are positively inﬂuenced by economic news. Finally,
there is evidence that several news announcements exert an asymmetric impact on market activity
variables.

1. Introduction
The relationship between information arrival and asset price
movements is of central importance to price formation and price
discovery in ﬁnancial markets, and is a topic that has been extensively investigated in the literature. For instance, the mixture of
distributions model relies on ‘‘news’’ to explain movements in asset returns (see Tauchen and Pitts, 1983). Among the various
sources of information the role of public information is frequently
examined because they are easily identiﬁable, and also carry implications for the canonical model of weakly efﬁcient markets which
posits that security prices reﬂect all available information. Chen
et al. (1986) highlight the importance of macroeconomic factors
such as industrial production and measures of unanticipated inﬂation on stock returns. In a related study, Flannery and Protopapadakis (2002) relate equity returns to macroeconomic variables.
More recently, research attention has shifted to an examination
of intra-day data that provides additional insights into the market
microstructure behavior relating to trading and pricing variables.
As a case in point, Adams et al. (2004) show that unanticipated
inﬂationary news has distinguishable effects on intra-day equity
returns, and that most of this information is incorporated within
minutes of the news release.

This paper explores the price formation process and trading volume activity in the metals futures market around the release of
new macroeconomic information. Four important questions are addressed. First, what is the impact of macroeconomic news on the
return, realized volatility and volume of gold, silver and copper
futures? Second, does the release of macroeconomic news affect
the three metals in different ways? Third, how long does it take
for the impact of macroeconomic news shocks to be fully absorbed
by the market? Finally, does the metals market respond asymmetrically to the release of unexpected macroeconomic news?
The answers to these questions are important for several reasons.
First, our analysis is based on high-frequency intra-day data, which
allows us to detect patterns of market reaction that may not be easily
discerned in lower frequency daily data. In this regard, it is important to point out that the empirical literature using daily data ﬁnds
only mixed or relatively weak evidence of the link between macroeconomic announcements and commodity prices (see Roache and
Rossi, 2010; Hess et al., 2008), thus lending support to the argument
that, unlike other assets, commodity prices are predetermined with
respect to US macroeconomic aggregates such as real output, consumption and investment variables (Kilian and Vega, 2010). Therefore, an investigation of how an important class of commodities,
speciﬁcally metals, responds to macroeconomic news at intra-day
frequencies provides a meaningful contrast with existing studies.
Based on Andersen’s (1996) argument that different types of news
may have different stochastic arrival processes and therefore convey
varying impacts on pricing behavior, we evaluate the impact of 19
different types of macroeconomic news. These announcements are
sorted by the time of each news release, with the aim of identifying

52

J. Elder et al. / Journal of Banking & Finance 36 (2012) 51–65

those announcement times that have the largest impact on the metals market. Furthermore, taking into account evidence from related
asset markets such as equities (Koutmos and Booth, 1995), we also
examine whether or not metal futures respond asymmetrically to
economic news. We contend that a study of how metal futures prices
react to positive versus negative economic surprises would be informative not only in terms of market efﬁciency and information processing, but may also provide an explanation as to why previous
studies that do not account for potential asymmetries may have
been unsuccessful in documenting a signiﬁcant relationship between economic news and commodity prices.
Second, compared to ﬁnancial assets, there is a relative paucity
of studies that examine the role of information in the metal futures
markets. This is especially noteworthy considering that in recent
years there has been a steady increase in the amount of investor
attention given to these markets. In general, the popularity of commodities, and in particular metals, stems from the belief that these
assets act as a hedge against inﬂation, offer valuable diversiﬁcation
opportunities to investors, serve as a monetary medium during
times of market uncertainty, and have a wide range of manufacturing and industrial applications. It is therefore not entirely surprising that these products are one of the most heavily traded in
organized futures exchanges.
Finally, our study is comprehensive in scope in that it evaluates
the responsiveness of several market activity variables including
return, volatility and trading volume. We construct a realized volatility measure that accounts for intra-day price information within each particular time interval.
Therefore, to summarize, our sample period, research design,
and empirical methods allow us to investigate more fully the
high-frequency dynamics of three important commodities. The
remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next two sections we provide a literature review and discuss theoretical considerations, respectively. Section 4 explains the data sources,
summary statistics and cleaning procedures. Section 5 provides a
brief description of the research design and empirical methods,
and discusses the results. Section 6 concludes the paper.

2. Literature review
A survey of the literature in the metals commodities markets reveals three major research streams: (a) characterization of the distributional properties of metal prices (Khalifa et al., 2011); (b)
identiﬁcation of dynamic relationships between futures and spot
prices of various metals (Kocagil, 1997); and (c) examination of metals as a hedge against inﬂation, currency rate risk, and market uncertainty (Baur and Lucey, 2010). Our study on how metal futures
market responds to macroeconomic news adds a new dimension
to the literature and carries implications for market efﬁciency, risk
premia, and the pricing and trade behavior of gold, copper and silver.
Although there is a vast amount of literature that documents
the effects of macroeconomic news on stocks (e.g., Boyd et al.,
2005), bonds (e.g., Simpson and Ramchander, 2004; Nowak et al.,
2011) and currencies (e.g., Simpson et al., 2005; Chen and Gau,
2010), the corresponding literature on the reaction of metal prices
to economic announcements is relatively scarce. Some notable
exceptions exist. Using daily data, in a broader examination of 12
different commodities including gold, silver and copper, Roache
and Rossi (2010) ﬁnd that daily prices are relatively insensitive
to macroeconomic news. Hess et al. (2008) provide a state-dependent interpretation of macroeconomic news by showing that daily
commodity prices are responsive only during recessionary periods,
but not during periods of economic growth.
To our knowledge there are only two studies that use intra-day
data to examine gold and/or silver prices. Christie-David et al.

(2000) use intra-day 15-min transaction prices between 1992
and 1995 to show that the impact of economic surprises on the return variance of gold and silver futures prices is less pronounced
compared to interest rate futures. Cai et al. (2001) provide a detailed characterization of return volatility in gold futures using 5min returns between 1994 and 1997. They ﬁnd that the impact
of macroeconomic announcements is much smaller on gold compared to the impact on Treasury bond or currency markets, and
only four announcements – jobs report, inﬂation, GDP and personal
income – carry statistically signiﬁcant effects on gold volatility.
Our study differs from both Christie-David et al. (2000) and Cai
et al. (2001) in several regards. First, we use a longer and more recent time frame (2002 through 2008) for the analysis, a period during which metal prices experienced a dramatic increase in price
and trading activity. For instance, the futures price of gold increased more than threefold during this period (from about $278
per troy ounce in 2002 to about $1003 in 2008). There was also a
corresponding rise in aggregate trading volume from about 6.8
million contracts in 2001 to more than 38 million in 2008.1 Second,
our study is more comprehensive in scope since we consider the impact of economic news on three important market activity variables
– i.e., returns, volatility and trading volume. Third, we differentiate
our work from prior studies by constructing a realized volatility
measure that has been shown to provide consistent estimates of
integrated volatility in the underlying price process (see BarndorffNielsen and Shephard, 2002).2 A ﬁnal point of distinction is that
our study allows for the possibility of return, realized volatility
and volume measures to respond asymmetrically to macroeconomic
news announcements, and examines the persistence of economic
shocks in the metals futures market.
3. Theoretical considerations
Physical commodities are different from most ﬁnancial assets in
that they are continuously produced and consumed. The fact that
they can be stored implies that production need not be consumed
at once. Therefore, mismatches between production and consumption levels can lead to either accumulation or depletion of inventory resulting in price changes. The theory of storage (see
Brennan, 1958) highlights the role of the interest costs of storing
the commodity as an important determinant of commodity price
changes. In this framework, an unexpected increase in interest
rates reduces the demand for inventories (since it raises storage
costs) and puts downward pressure on commodity prices.
Unfortunately, given that aggregate inventories are usually not
observable and inventory estimates are subject to potential misrepresentation, one may have to explain observed price changes
in the context of information arrival. It is in this context that an
examination of macroeconomic news, which reveals new information about future economic conditions, becomes pertinent in
explaining commodity price movements. However, it must be
noted that although news releases are expected to affect commodity prices by altering market beliefs about future economic conditions, the direction of the impact is indeterminate a priori. For
instance, announcements that cause market participants to revise

The price movement in the copper market is even more dramatic. Its price was
about $0.66 per pound at the beginning of 2002 and reached a peak in July 2008 when
it closed at about $4.04 per pound; only to drop precipitously to about $1.26 at the
end of 2008. The aggregated volume in copper futures increased from 2.8 million
contracts in 2001 to 4.56 million contracts in 2008. Silver also seem to have followed
a similar meteoric rise. It was about $4.53 per troy ounce at the beginning of 2002 and
closed at its peak at $20.92 in March 2008. The aggregate volume of silver futures
increased from 2.58 million in 2001 to 8.8 million in 2008.

Note that, however, the presence of microstructure noise may bias realized
volatility estimates. We account for such potential bias using alternative estimators,
as discussed in the ‘research design’ section of the study.

53

their expectations of inﬂation upwards may lead investors to
rebalance their portfolios by shifting out of money and into physical assets like commodities. This is likely to result in a positive
price change. On the other hand, based on the policy anticipation
hypothesis, if market participants anticipate a tighter monetary
policy response to curb higher inﬂation, this may cause real interest rates to rise, and along with slower expected economic growth,
drive down commodity prices. In sum, the response of commodity
price changes to macroeconomic news is an empirical issue since
the price response function is an amalgam of inﬂation expectations
and expected monetary policy response.
Predicting the price response can be further complicated by the
fact that there is a wide degree of variation among individual commodity types. This is illustrated by Erb and Harvey (2006) who ﬁnd
a low degree of correlation between different commodity futures
products. In the case of metals, it would be reasonable to expect
that the price response of precious metals (gold and silver) which
are often seen as an alternative investment vehicle is different
from industrial metals such as copper which is viewed a primary
input in manufacturing. Therefore, it is possible that a surprise
improvement in economic growth may cause gold and silver prices
to drop because of portfolio rebalancing effects, but result in higher
copper prices due to greater industrial demand.
The pattern of the response of trading volume to anticipated
announcements may also take different forms. Theoretical trading
models such as Glosten and Milgrom (1985) endow informed traders
with private information about impending announcements. Prior to
anticipated announcements, these models imply that liquidity declines, as market makers seek to protect themselves from trading
with informed traders, while volume may increase as long as the
beneﬁts of informed trading exceed the costs of trading. In these
models, the public announcement ameliorates the advantage of
the informed traders, and volume may be either low or high, depending on whether there is pent up demand from uninformed traders.
In models such as that described by Kim and Verrecchia (1994),
the acquisition of private information prior to the announcement is
endogenous, and depends on the cost of acquiring private information as well as the expected quality of the announcement. They
ﬁnd that volume after the announcement is directly related to
price volatility (measured as the absolute value of the price
change), with an increase in the quality of the announcement tending to strengthen the reaction of volume. There is no reason for
these characterizations to be mutually exclusive, so an empirical
study can offer evidence on which effect tends to dominate.
Finally, in comparison to returns and volume, our expected
response of volatility is somewhat more predictable. Ross (1989)
argues that in an arbitrage free economy return volatility should
be related to information arrival or variation in information frequencies. This argument is supported by Pasquariello and Vega
(2007) who ﬁnd that, ceteris paribus, price volatility increases in
the presence of public information signals. Our research attempts
to disentangle these various effects.

through Friday during the following hours (Eastern Standard
Time): 8:20 am–1:30 pm for gold, 8:25 am–1:25 pm for silver,
and 8:10 am–1:00 pm for copper. Trading is also offered simultaneously on the Globex electronic trading platform Sunday through
Friday from 6:00 pm–5:15 pm. The raw tick-by-tick futures price
data speciﬁes the time, to the nearest second, and the price of
the futures transaction. We construct a continuous price series
from front month contract, rolling over to the next contract when
the daily tick volume of the ﬁrst back-month contract exceeds the
daily tick volume of the current front month contract. This procedure avoids stale prices from the front-month contract that typically occur in the 4 weeks prior to expiration. The futures prices
are then sampled at 1-min discrete intervals, yielding about
500,000 price observations for each metal. The 1-min observations
are then used to construct 5-min return and volatility measures.
Table 1 reports summary statistics for the daily return series for
gold, silver and copper. Gold has a daily mean return of 0.065% and
standard deviation 1.23%. Copper and silver have daily mean returns of 0.0426% and 0.0511% respectively, and both have a daily
standard deviation of about 2%. The distribution of the return series for each metal exhibits negative skewness and excess kurtosis,
and for each series the Jarque–Bera test rejects the null hypothesis
of normality.
Our data on macroeconomic news releases consists of 19 different announcements and is obtained from Bloomberg. For each
announcement, we collect both the realized value and the consensus (median) forecast as reported in Bloomberg. Each announcement is released monthly on pre-arranged schedule and
disseminated immediately on newswires and other data providers.
In order to make meaningful comparison of the estimated news
impact across the three asset classes and different news releases,
we ‘‘standardize’’ the news measures. Speciﬁcally, the unanticipated component, or surprise, in each announcement is computed
as the difference between the actual (or realized) value and the
consensus forecast, normalized by its standard deviation. Let Ai,t
denote the realized value of an announcement of type i at time t,
and Ei.t denote the consensus forecast. The standardized surprise
element of the announcement is deﬁned as:

SAi;t ¼

Ai;t  Ei;t

ð1Þ

ri

where ri is the sample standard deviation of the surprise component of the type i announcement, Ai,t  Ei.t. Because ri is constant
for each announcement, the standardization procedure should not
affect the statistical signiﬁcance of the estimated response coefﬁcients and ﬁt of the regression model.
We also calibrate each surprise announcement so that a positive
value represents stronger-than-expected economic growth, and a
negative value represents weaker-than-expected economic
growth. Therefore, we switch the sign for the unemployment rate
surprise so that positive surprise represents an unemployment rate
that is lower than expected.
We classify the 19 macroeconomic announcements into three
categories depending on the time of each announcement. There

This table lists the 19 different types of macroeconomic announcements along with the standard deviation of the surprise component. The
surprise component is measured by: Surprise = Actual – Forecast. (For personal consumption, we only have data from 2003. For business
inventories, some of the announcements were at 8:30 and others at 10.)

4.2. Data cleaning and control sample
We clean the data using the following steps. First, we exclude
any weekend announcements. For instance, there are 28
announcements on Saturdays (23 business inventories, four capacity utilization and one durable goods orders) and two announcements on Sundays (1 CPI and 1 for housing starts). Since there is
no trading on weekends, we remove these 30 announcements. Second, in order to minimize bias due to stale prices and nonsynchronous trading we eliminate days with relatively low trading activity.
3
Business inventory is a special case. It was released at 8:30 am before June 2003.
It was sometimes released at 8:30 am and sometimes at 10:00 am from June 2003 to
November 2005. However, since December 2005 it has been always released at
10:00 am. Therefore, there are 10 announcements plus some of the business
inventory announcements at 8:30, and there are 6 other announcements plus some
of the business inventory announcements at 10:00.

are 11 announcements at 8:30 am, two announcements at

the different types of macroeconomic and the associated time of release. A survey of the different economic announcements indicates
that there are: (a) eight real activity economic variables (advance retail sales, capacity utilization, changes in nonfarm payroll, personal
income, unemployment rate, housing starts, industrial production,
and NAPM); (b) three consumption variables (personal consumption
expenditure, new home sales, trade balance); (c) four investment
variables (business inventories, durable goods orders, construction
spending, factory orders); (d) two price variables (CPI, PPI); and (e)
two forward looking variables (consumer conﬁdence, leading
indicators).
There are a total of 1584 announcements during the sample
period. The distribution of macroeconomic announcements is
shown in Fig. 1. All announcements are released each month on
a prescheduled day at a ﬁxed time. With the exception of the
Employment Situation Report, which includes information about
nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate, and which are usually released on Fridays, most other announcements are evenly distributed through the week. The news releases also appear to be
clustered around the middle of the month, with elevated levels
during the beginning and end of each month.

There are about 310, 290, and 300 1-min price intervals per trading
day for gold, copper and silver, respectively. We remove those days
from the sample where the number of 1-min price observations is

55

J. Elder et al. / Journal of Banking & Finance 36 (2012) 51–65

found to be less than 50% of the number of price observations in a
normal trading day. Finally, similar to Ederington and Lee (1993),
we construct a control sample consisting of trading intervals that
are not contaminated by one of our 19 scheduled news announcements. The control sample allows us to make meaningful statistical
inferences on the impact of announcements and also accounts for
any potential intraday patterns in the data.
We examine price and volume in the study over a 50-min time
period: 10 min prior to the new release and 40 min after the new
release. We compare the study sample response to economic news
with a time-matched control sample that is constructed using observations from days when there are no macroeconomic announcements. For example, the 8:30 am study sample includes all days
with at least one announcement at 8:30 am, and the corresponding
control sample for the 8:30 am announcement is constructed from
all remaining days with no macroeconomic announcements. The
resulting sample size over each announcement window for gold, silver and copper are reported in Table 3. After deleting days with low
trading activity, we have, for the 8:30 announcement interval,
609 days with price information for gold in the study sample versus
751 days in the control sample. The control sample for copper and
silver consists of 605 and 772 days, respectively. In general, we have
fewer number of 9:15 announcements compared to the other two
announcement times. Also, there are far fewer observations for
trading volume (reported in parenthesis) since data for volume is
available only for 2 years, 2007 and 2008.

5. Research design and empirical results
5.1. Return, volatility and volume measures
The return (in percent) during the ith interval on day t is calculated as: Rti = 100  (logPc,t,i  logPo,t,i), where, Pc,t,i and Po,t,i represent the closing and opening prices during the ith interval on day
t Volume for the ith interval on day t, Vti, is the cumulative volume
during that interval.
The intra-day volatility in the return series is measured using
realized volatility. Realized volatility, also known as the cumulative intra-day squared return measure of volatility, was introduced
by Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) for high-frequency data. The
realized volatility (in percent) during an interval (ti1,ti] is calcuP
lated as rt;i ¼ ð nj¼1 R2j Þ1=2 ; where rti is the volatility measure and
n is the number of (return) observations during that period of time.
Note in our study we sample the data at 1-min frequency; therefore, the realized variance for each 5 min interval is the sum of
the ﬁve 1-min squared returns.
The popularity of RV in high-frequency studies stems from the
fact that it provides a consistent estimator of the daily variation
of returns when prices are measured continuously and without
measurement error (see Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, 2002).
However, empirical studies suggest that when prices are sampled
at ultra-high intervals (for instance, tick-by-tick data) the presence
of market microstructure dynamics can render RV to be a biased
and inconsistent estimator for quadratic variation (see Hansen
and Lunde, 2006). Therefore, to lend robustness to our analysis
we also estimate the Hansen and Lunde (2006) bias-corrected realized volatility measure and use these estimates in our regressions
that examine the impact of macroeconomic news on volatility.4

The correction incorporates the ﬁrst-order auto-covariance terms proposed by

Zhou (1996) as follows: RV ti; AC1 ¼ nj¼1 R2j þ 2 n1

ensure that the bias-corrected RV terms remain positive, Hansen and Lunde (2006)

This table reports the total number of observations in the study sample and control
sample for the 8:30, 9:15, and 10:00 announcements. The numbers in parenthesis
are the number of days in the trading volume sample. We have volume data only for
2007 and 2008.

These results suggest that microstructure noise has negligible effects on realized volatility, and furthermore the conclusions
regarding the impact of news on volatility generally remain unaffected when using the bias-corrected RV measure.5 Therefore, for
the remainder of the paper we provide results that pertain only to
the standard RV measure.
5.2. News impact on return, volatility and volume
The response of returns, volatility and volume is reported in
Table 4 in the form of statistical tests on the equality of means
for returns, volatility and volume around the three pre-scheduled
announcement times (8:30, 9:15, 10:00). We conduct these tests
along two dimensions: (a) the difference between the calculated
returns (and realized volatility and volume) over the 5-min
interval immediately prior to each set of announcements and the
5-min interval immediately after each set of announcements, for
both the control and study samples; and (b) the difference between
the returns (and realized volatility and volume) over the 5-min
control interval and the study interval, both immediately prior to
each set of announcements and immediately after each set of
announcements.
Panels A, B, and C of Table 4 report the results for gold, copper,
and silver, respectively. The results in Panel A suggest that economic announcements do not have a signiﬁcant effect on gold returns. For the 8:30 announcements, the change in returns before
and after the announcement for the study sample is positive, with
returns from 0.0107% to 0.0132%, although the difference is not
statistically signiﬁcant (with a t-statistic of 0.2124). Similarly, the
difference in returns between the study sample and the control
sample is not signiﬁcant, either before or after the announcement.
For the 9:15 announcements, returns after the announcement are
greater than returns during the control sample, although the difference is again not signiﬁcant for either the study or the control samples. Again, the difference in returns between the study sample and
the control sample is also not signiﬁcant, either before or after the
announcement. Similar results are obtained for gold returns
around the 10:00 announcement.
The results for realized volatility around the announcements
contrast sharply with those for returns. For example, around the
8:30 announcement realized volatility for the study sample increases from 0.1070% to 0.1986%, with a t-statistic in excess of
13. This difference is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Realized volatility also increases after the 9:15 and 10:00 announcements, with the increase again statistically signiﬁcant at the 1%
level, although the magnitude of the increase is about half that
for the 8:30 announcements. Realized volatility after the

This table reports tests of equality in means of returns, realized volatilities, and volume around the announcements intervals at 8:30, 9:15 and 10:00 for gold, copper and
silver. The returns, realized volatilities, and volumes are calculated over 5 min intervals before and after the announcement time points. Tests for equality in means between
the returns, realized volatilities and volumes before and after the announcements are reported for both the control sample and the study sample. We also report tests of
equality between the control and study samples, both prior to and after the announcement. The Welch’s t-test, sometimes called ‘‘Satterthwaite–Welch t-test’’, allows for
unequal cell variances in samples. In our case, the p-values of the Welch’s t-test are only slightly higher than the standard t-test. The returns and volatilities are expressed in
percentages (i.e., multiplied by 100).

announcement is also signiﬁcantly greater than the control sample
(at the 1% level) for each announcement, although the difference is
again about half as large for the 9:15 and 10:00 announcements,
relative to the 8:30 announcements. Our results, therefore, provide
strong evidence that macroeconomic news announcements have a
positive and signiﬁcant impact on realized volatility of the return
on metal futures.
We plot the response of realized volatility around the three
announcement times (8:30, 9:15, 10:00) for the study sample
and the control sample in Fig. 2. The time stamp on the horizontal

axis indicates the end of the 5-min interval, e.g., 8:35 covers the
period 8:30 to 8:35, and so on. The ﬁgure clearly illustrates the tendency of volatility to spike around each of the announcement windows, 8:30, 9:15 and 10:00. Volatility tends to be high for the
control sample near the market open for all three metals, but the
volatility over the study sample appears to be substantively greater. Visual inspection of the 9:15 and 10:00 announcements indicates that volatility is also unusually high relative to the control
sample, although the differences are not as pronounced as for the
8:30 announcements. Finally, there is evidence that the effect of

announcements on volatility decays relatively quickly, within
about 10 min. This may explain why previous studies that rely
on daily data are unable to identify a signiﬁcant relationship between commodity prices and economic announcements.
Finally, the results for volume, reported in the bottom of Panel
A, are comparable to realized volatility around the 8:30 and 10:00
announcements. At the 8:30 and 10:00 announcements, volume
surges over the study sample, although the magnitude of the increase is much larger for the 8:30 announcement. Interestingly,
the change in volume around the 9:15 set of announcements is
not found to be statistically signiﬁcant.
Panels B and C of Table 6 presents the results for copper and silver. In the interest of brevity, the discussion on these two markets
is restricted to just a couple of notable observations. First, the
announcement effects documented for gold are also generally evident for copper and silver. In other words, announcements tend
have a positive and signiﬁcant impact on volatility and volume.
However, in contrast with gold, the 8:30 and 9:15 announcements
have a statistically signiﬁcant inﬂuence on copper returns and the
10:00 announcements have an impact on silver returns. Second,
similar to the evidence for gold, the 8:30 set of announcements
have the largest impact on volatility and volume for both copper
and silver, followed by the 10:00 and 9:15 news releases.
5.3. Marginal impact of news
5.3.1. Response of returns
Having established the differential impact of aggregate news
announcements on returns, volume and volatility between the

study and control sample, we now investigate the marginal impact
of each macroeconomic news release on returns. In the ﬁrst step
we ﬁt a univariate regression model of the following form:

Rtiþ1 ¼ b0 þ bj SAj;ti þ etiþ1

ð2Þ

where Rti is the 5-min return at time ti+1, (ti+1 could be 8:35, 9:20, or
10:05 on day t, whereas ti takes one of the values at 8:30, 9:15, or
10:00), SAj;ti is the standardized surprise of the jth announcement
at time ti on day t, and bo and bi are parameters to be estimated.
The regression estimates correspond to days when there is at least
one news announcement.
Table 5 reports estimated coefﬁcients with corresponding t-statistics, p-values and adjusted R-squares obtained from the individual regression models. The results are discussed ﬁrst for the 8:30
announcement, followed by the 9:15 and 10:00 announcements.
We notice that several 8:30 announcements have a signiﬁcant impact on gold, copper and silver prices. All three metal prices are
sensitive to surprises in durable goods orders, but in different
ways. In particular, durable goods order has a negative inﬂuence
on gold and silver prices, but is positively associated with copper
prices. In interpreting the coefﬁcient values it is worth pointing
out that the numbers measure the response of the 5-min postannouncement return to a one standard deviation change in the
^SDGO ¼ 0:0644
surprise element of the news. For instance, the b
coefﬁcient value for gold implies that a one standard deviation
unexpected increase (decrease) in durable goods orders causes a
decrease (increase) in the price of gold futures by about 0.06% in
the 5 min after the announcement. In terms of adjusted R-square
values, among the various 8:30 announcements, the nonfarm

payroll indicator has the highest degree of explanatory power in
the regressions for gold (35%) and silver (23%). The importance of
payroll information has been documented in earlier studies such
as Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) who refer to the Employment
Situation or Jobs Report as the ‘‘king’’ of all announcements because of the signiﬁcant sensitivity of most asset prices to its public
release. We also observe advance retail sales to have a strong inﬂuence on gold and silver; whereas, trade balance ﬁgures prominently in explaining copper and silver returns. Interestingly, we
ﬁnd silver to be the most responsive to the 8:30 news releases with

4 out of 11 announcements having a signiﬁcant impact on prices.
Finally, housing starts surprises have a positive and signiﬁcant
inﬂuence only on copper returns.
An evaluation of the 9:15 announcements indicates that both
capacity utilization and industrial production have a negative
inﬂuence on gold returns. The estimated coefﬁcients of the two
announcements are respectively 0.027 (regression adjusted
R2 = 3.32%) and 0.0325 (regression adjusted R2 = 5.56%) and are
statistically signiﬁcant at the 10% level or lower. In the case of
copper, only industrial production has an inﬂuence on copper.

Notably, the 9:15 announcements do not have an impact on silver
returns.
Among the 10:00 announcements, business inventories have
the highest degree of explanatory power for gold and silver returns
with adjusted R-square values of 17.5% and 9.17%, respectively.
Surprises in business inventories have a negative impact on both
gold and silver returns. In the case of copper, however, returns in
this market are positively and signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by NAPM
and new home sales announcements. Again, as in the 8:30
announcements, silver prices are the most sensitive to the 10:00
set of announcements.
The results in Table 5 provide meaningful insights into the
nature of the relationship between economic announcements
and returns. First, announcements that reﬂect an unexpected
improvement in the economy tend to have a negative impact on
gold and silver prices, but a positive effect on copper. For instance,
a better than expected economic growth as conveyed by improvements in real activity (e.g., advance retail sales), consumption (e.g.,
new home sales) and investment (e.g., durable goods orders) has a
negative effect on gold and silver prices. One possible explanation
for this behavior is that an unexpected improvement in the economy may reduce investors’ appetite for precious metals as they
seek alternative investments such as stocks and bonds that appear
to be relatively more attractive in this environment. On the other
hand, copper returns are positively related with economic growth
variables (e.g., durable goods orders, housing starts, NAPM). This
may be attributed to the fact that copper is an important input
good in manufacturing and production related industries (about
70% of the demand for copper comes from electrical and construction industries), and a more sanguine economic climate would be
indicative of greater demand for this industrial metal.
In the next step of the empirical analysis we ﬁt a multivariate
regression model of the form:

Rtiþ1 ¼ c þ

N
X

bj SAj;ti þ etiþ1

ð3Þ

j¼1

To estimate Eq. (3), we pool together all days with at least one 8:30
(9:15, 10:00) announcement together to form the 8:30 (9:15, 10:00)

study sample. In addition to estimating the full model, we also estimate a stepwise regression model that identiﬁes a restricted set of
regressors in the joint model with the most inﬂuential factors. For
the purpose of discussion, only the stepwise results are reported
in the paper.6 Stepwise regressions allow some or all of the independent variables in a standard linear multivariate regression to
be chosen automatically from a set of variables.7 However, in order
to ensure that the stepwise approach does not lead to model overﬁtting and result in falsely eliminating inﬂuential variables with less
signiﬁcant relationships at the start of the stepwise selection procedure, we check for consistency of the stepwise coefﬁcients both with
the univariate model and the full joint regression model containing
all economic variables in the system. We also allow for manual additions of selected factors from economic categories that are not represented in the stepwise approach.
The stepwise regression results, which are reported in Table 6,
are largely consistent with the univariate regression results discussed earlier. Remarkably, variables that were identiﬁed to be
inﬂuential in the univariate regressions are also found to be significant in the multivariate regressions. We ﬁnd that the 8:30 set of
announcements have the largest impact on gold and silver prices
(adjusted R-square values of 23.11% and 14.93%, respectively);
whereas, the 9:15 and 10:00 announcements are relatively more
inﬂuential for copper (adjusted R-squares of 28.33% and 6.21%,

The joint regression model results can be obtained from the authors.
Our stepwise regressions are performed by using the stepwise-forwards method.
The stepwise-forwards begins with no additional regressions in the regression, then
adds the variable with the lowest p-value. The variable with the next lowest p-value
given that the ﬁrst variable has already been chosen, is then added. Next both of the
added variables are checked against the backwards p-value criterion. Any variable
whose p-value is higher than the criterion is removed. Once the removal step has
been performed, the next variable is added. At this, and each successive addition to
the model, all the previously added variables are checked against the backwards
criterion and possibly removed. The stepwise-forwards routine ends when the lowest
p-value of the variables not yet included is greater than the speciﬁed forward
stopping criteria. We choose both the forward and backward criteria to be 10%. While
such methods are subject to pretest bias, we still view the results as informative in
their tendency to highlight variables with the greatest explanatory power.

respectively). Among the 8:30 announcements, nonfarm payrolls
and durable goods orders seem to clearly dominate the price
changes on all three metals.
5.3.2. Response of volatility and volume
This section discusses results of the impact of macroeconomic
news release on realized volatility and trading volume for the three
metals. To examine volatility, we again ﬁt joint regression models

along with their stepwise forms for the realized volatility of each
metal return series. For the sake of brevity only the reduced stepwise regression results are reported and discussed. In the case of
trading volume we are able to estimate only the stepwise regression. This is because the joint regression models face a singularity
problem due to a limited number of observations (volume data
covers 2007 and 2008) and a relatively large number of regressors.
The joint regression model has the following expression:

jth announcement. To control for the persistence in volatility and
volume, we include three lags of the left hand side variable as
regressors.8
The estimated results of the stepwise regression models for the
realized volatility are presented in Table 7. Several interesting
observations emerge. First, among the 19 different types of
announcements, unanticipated news in nonfarm payroll has the
greatest impact on the volatility of all three markets. A one standard deviation absolute unexpected shock in nonfarm payroll results in a 0.14%, 0.08% and 0.20% size increase in the realized
volatilities of gold, copper and silver returns, respectively. Recall
that the means of the 5-min realized volatility during the 8:30–
8:35 interval in the control samples are only 0.12%, 0.14% and
0.23% for the gold, copper and silver futures returns. Viewed in this
context, increases in volatility caused by nonfarm payrolls are

8
Notice that for returns we do not include the lagged dependent variables since
returns do not exhibit persistence. For volume and volatility, however, we ﬁnd the
persistence parameter to be statistically signiﬁcant in all our regressions. Since the
focus of our discussion is on new impact variables these coefﬁcient values are not
reported; however, they may be obtained from the authors upon request.

about 116%, 57% and 87% of the magnitudes of the corresponding
means in the three markets. Second, the announcements explain
the largest fraction of variation in gold volatility, with adjusted
R-square values about 35% for the 8:30 and 9:15 announcements,
and 23% for the 10:00 announcements. Third, economic news
announcements are generally associated with elevated levels of
volatility, as thirteen of the seventeen reported coefﬁcients are
positive.
Using volume data for the 2 year period 2007 and 2008, the
stepwise models identify that, in all instances, the reported
announcements have a positive inﬂuence on trading volume (Table
8). We interpret these results are most consistent with the model
of informed trading depicted by Kim and Verrecchia (1994), in
which informed traders tend to have an advantage in processing
new information after it is released, rather than in predicting
new information. Once again, as in the volatility regression, the
twin 8:30 announcements of nonfarm payroll and unemployment
rate dominate the announcement shocks. For instance, a one standard deviation shock in nonfarm payroll results in the transaction
volume of gold to increase by about 900 contracts in the 5 min
following the announcement. Comparatively, the average trading

This table reports the estimated stepwise regression models for the realized volatility (RV) 5 min after each announcement. The stepwise regressions pick up only the
announcements which have an impact on the 5-min realized volatility at the 10% signiﬁcance level. The stepwise regression models have the form:

volume during the entire 8:30–8:35 for all the days in the control
sample is only about 959 contracts. Similarly, the volume in the silver contract increases by 218 contracts during this interval compared to an average volume of only about 326 contracts in the
control sample. We should note, however, that none of the 9:15
announcements are signiﬁcant in any of the volume regressions.
5.4. Persistence of announcement shocks on returns, volatility and
volume
The regression results thus far provide evidence on the immediate post-announcement 5-min interval response of gold, silver and
copper. In this section, we expand the announcement window to
investigate the persistence of announcement shocks on returns,
volatility and volume. Speciﬁcally, we run a series of regressions
at 5-min intervals, spanning 10 min before the announcement
and up to 40 min after the announcement, and obtain the adjusted
R-square values. The R-square values from the regression are then
plotted across time to interpret the persistence of announcement
shocks. Figs. 3–5 report this evidence for returns, volatility and
volume.
An overview of Fig. 3 suggests that the impact of news announcements on returns dissipates very quickly. Notably, during the 8:30–
8:35 min interval, the highest adjusted R-square values are found
for gold and silver. In contrast, copper exhibits a somewhat delayed
response to the 8:30 announcement. For the 9:15 announcements,
there is about a 30-min delay before the realization of the highest
adjusted R-square for gold and silver. This might explain why we

were unable to substantiate a post-announcement effect on returns
for these two metals. Copper prices, on the other hand, seem to
incorporate the 9:15 announcements quite rapidly. For the 10:00
announcements, the highest adjusted R-squares for gold and copper
regressions is realized during the immediate aftermath of the
announcement, whereas there is about a 5–10 min delay in the peak
response of silver prices. In all cases, we observe that the metal
prices are efﬁcient in incorporating new economic information
and the response tends to dissipate in less than an hour after the release of the announcement. Importantly, these results provide an
interesting contrast to studies that use low frequency observations
and document the sluggish price responsiveness of commodities.
Similar to Fig. 3, the evidence from shocks to volatility and volume – Figs. 4 and 5, respectively – also paints a picture where both
market activity variables are responsive to announcements. However, compared to returns, there tends to be far more persistence
in volatility and volume shocks (particularly with 9:15 and 10:00
announcements) suggesting that these two variables are characterized by different properties. Again, in most cases, shocks seem to
dissipate within 60 min after the news release.
5.5. Asymmetric impact of news on returns, volatility and volume
We have thus far investigated the differential effects, intensity
and speed of macroeconomic shocks. The regression results implicate several announcements, chieﬂy nonfarm payroll and durable
goods orders, as having a disproportionate inﬂuence in the metals
market. The presence of asymmetric response, where the impacts

of positive surprises and negative surprises cancel each other, may
be one possible reason as to why some announcements are not
found to be signiﬁcant. In this section, we examine the differential
or asymmetric response of returns, realized volatility, and volume
to positive versus negative positive economic surprises by running
a multivariate regression model of the following form:

where Y tiþ1 denotes the return, realized volatility or volume during
the i + 1 5-min interval at day t when there is at least one announce
ment, and SAþ
j;t i , and SAj;t i refer to the positive and negative components of the surprise of the jth announcement. Based on our setup,
there are two possible ways in which asymmetries can be observed:
(1) both negative and positive surprises have signiﬁcant impacts, but
the magnitudes of their impacts are statistically different from each
þ
other, that is, jb
j j – jbj j (a Wald test is conducted to render judgment
on the equality of the two coefﬁcients); (2) only either negative or poþ
sitive surprises are statistically signiﬁcant, that is, b
j ¼ 0; bj – 0; or

þ
bj – 0; bj ¼ 0, in which case this would automatically indicate the
presence of an asymmetric response. We estimate the full regression
model, but report only its stepwise counterpart in Tables 9–11.
The results in Table 9 for gold, copper and silver returns show
that several news announcements are inﬂuential, and importantly
have an asymmetric effect on returns. For gold futures, the Wald
test indicates that NAPM has an asymmetric impact with
þ
jb
NAPM j ¼ 0:04 – jbNAPM j ¼ 0:29; that is, positive surprises of NAPM
have larger impacts than negative ones. There are several other
announcements where only either positive or negative surprises
are statistically signiﬁcant, again suggesting the asymmetric nat-

ure of the returns response. The inﬂuential positive surprises (i.e.,
better than expected economic growth) include unemployment
rate, advance retail sales, business inventories and factory orders.
On the other hand, negative economic shocks in trade balance, personal consumption, durable goods orders, industrial production,
and consumer conﬁdence are signiﬁcant.
For copper returns, we observe asymmetric responses to durable goods orders, personal consumption, PPI, housing starts, trade
balance, new home sales, industrial production and capacity utilization. For the silver futures, we ﬁnd asymmetric impacts from
trade balance, advance retail sales, personal consumption and
NAPM. Finally, both positive and negative nonfarm payroll surprises have a pronounced inﬂuence on gold and silver returns;
and importantly this impact is not asymmetric.
The asymmetric impact of economic news on realized volatility
is reported in Table 10. First, not surprisingly, in all three markets
both positive and negative economic surprises exacerbate realized
volatility. Second, the results generally supports the notion that
‘‘bad’’ news has a stronger impact than ‘‘good’’ news – i.e., negative
economic surprises generally have a larger effect on volatility than
positive surprises. The estimated results for gold demonstrate that
negative surprises in nonfarm payroll, unemployment rate, trade
balance, capacity utilization and consumer conﬁdence increase
realized volatility, while only one positive announcement – nonfarm payrolls – signiﬁcantly increases volatility. Also, note that
the 8:30 announcements again dominate, with only one of the
9:15 announcements containing sufﬁcient information to cause
volatility to increase.
The estimated results for copper demonstrate that several
announcements – nonfarm payrolls, personal income, personal
consumption, PPI, housing starts and NAPM – have an asymmetric

J. Elder et al. / Journal of Banking & Finance 36 (2012) 51–65

impact on realized volatility. In the case of silver, many announcements that were found to have an asymmetric impact on gold volatility also have an asymmetric effect on silver volatility.
Furthermore, Wald test for the equality of trade balance coefﬁcients suggest that the magnitude of negative surprises is about

three times that of positive surprises ðbþ
TB ¼ 0:0405; bTB ¼ 1:5636Þ.
The asymmetric impact on trading volume is presented in Table
11. In general, volume in all three metals is higher in the immediate aftermath of both positive and negative news announcements.
Overall, the prominence of unemployment rate and nonfarm payroll surprises is substantiated.
6. Concluding remarks
The question of whether commodity prices are inﬂuenced by
macroeconomic fundamentals or whether they are predetermined
with respect to monetary aggregates is a topic that has yet to ﬁnd
consensus. Although there are strong economic reasons to expect
commodity prices to be sensitive to macroeconomic fundamentals,
prior empirical studies have not been very successful in documenting a strong relationship. We suggest that this might be due to several reasons including measurement of data at low (daily or
monthly) frequencies and research methods that do not control
for asymmetric impacts.
We undertake a comprehensive examination of the response of
return, volatility and trading volume for gold, copper and silver to
19 different types of macroeconomic announcements. Notably, we
rely on an improved analytical framework that uses high-frequency data for a sample period spanning 7 years from 2002 to
2008. The announcements are classiﬁed by time and direction
(i.e., whether the news release signals better-than-expected-economic news or worse-than-expected news) in order to: (a) identify
the most important set of announcements; (b) trace the persistence of macroeconomic shocks; and (c) allow for asymmetry in
the relationships.
Our analysis reveals that news releases have a strong and
instantaneous impact on all three metals. First, the 8:30 set of
announcements appear to have the largest impact on prices, realized volatility and trading volume during the immediate postannouncement 5 min interval. For instance, univariate regression
models show that surprises in nonfarm payroll (released at
8:30 am) explain about 35% and 23% of the returns of gold and
silver, respectively during the 8:30–8:35 time interval. Copper
returns, on the hand, are more sensitive to the 9:15 set of
announcements which include capacity utilization and industrial
production. The evidence suggests that the behavior of commodity
markets is quite similar to other asset markets in terms of their
responsiveness to economic information. Our results for volume
are most consistent with informed trading models where informed
traders tend to have an advantage in processing, rather than predicting, new information.
Second, our results indicate that the metals market respond in
an economically predictable manner. Unexpected improvement
in economic growth has a negative impact on gold and silver
prices, but registers a favorable effect on copper returns. For instance, improvements in real economic activity (e.g., advance retail
sales), consumption (e.g., new home sales) and investment (e.g.,
durable goods orders) are found to negatively inﬂuence gold and
silver prices. The performance of copper, on the other hand, is consistent with its status as an important industrial metal that beneﬁts primarily from unexpected growth in the economy.
Finally, our evidence indicates that the effect of macroeconomic
news dissipates quickly, within about 60 min of the news release,
and notably, and that several announcements have an asymmetric

65

impact on market activity variables. These results provide an
insightful contrast to previous studies that use daily data to examine the relationship between macroeconomic news and commodity
prices.
