Abstract
In a general real business cycle model, we derive a pricing kernel that involves only production
function arguments. The productivity shock is the single factor and the capital stock relative to a
productivity measure is the conditioning variable. The model compares favorably with the
complementary consumption-based and market-based approaches and with the Fama-French
three-factor model. A size premium arises from differences in unconditional sensitivities—small ﬁrms
are more sensitive to productivity shocks—and a value premium from differences in conditional
sensitivities to productivity shocks—growth ﬁrms are more sensitive to productivity shocks when the
productivity risk premium is low.

1. Introduction
The consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) of Breeden (1979), which
involves a pricing kernel related to the marginal utility of consumption, is the premier
theory explaining return variation across assets from an optimizing intertemporal
perspective. However, the consumption-based approach faces three major empirical
challenges in explaining asset prices: (1) the equity premium puzzle—variation in the
marginal utility of consumption is insufﬁcient to explain the average level of excess returns
(Mehra and Prescott, 1985); (2) the almost complete absence of cross-sectional explanatory
power—the consumption growth rate has little explanatory power for excess returns across
asset classes (Mankiw and Shapiro, 1986); and (3) the low covariance between the risk
premium and the betas—the covariance between consumption (market) betas and the
consumption (market) risk premium obtained from a series of estimates over small time
windows is too small to support the importance of any conditioning variable (Lewellen and
Nagel, 2006).
A broad explanation for the poor empirical performance of the CCAPM is that the
marginal utility of consumption depends not only on consumption but also on an
additional variable ‘‘x’’. This variable may be a state variable yielding a model with
consumption growth as the factor, where the risk premium and the betas are conditional
on the state variable. Prominent conditional models are those of Campbell and Cochrane
(1999), who use lagged consumption as the state variable, and Lettau and Ludvigson
(2001b), who employ the consumption-to-wealth ratio. These conditional models
answer for much of the CCAPM’s poor performance but are subject to the Lewellen
and Nagel critique.
The ‘‘x’’ variable may also be a contemporaneous variable, in which case we typically
obtain an unconditional multifactor model for which the Lewellen and Nagel critique does
not apply. Along this view, Parker and Julliard (2005) consider x to be a measurement
error, Abel (1990) adds a conspicuous consumption effect, Balvers and Huang (2007)
consider a model in which money appears in the utility function, Piasezzi, Schneider, and
Tuzel (2007) and Yogo (2006) allow for durable consumption goods, and below we
incorporate a preference for leisure. Evidently, even if we assume the functional form of
the utility function, there is no consensus on how to measure the marginal utility of
consumption: any combination of the proposed ‘‘x’’ variables may have a quantitatively
signiﬁcant impact on marginal utility.
A second approach explaining return variation across assets is that of Merton (1973),
which has as its pricing kernel the marginal utility of wealth. Complementary to the
CCAPM, the advantage of the Merton model is that changes in wealth can be related
directly to market returns. The marginal utility of wealth is also affected by state variables
that summarize how valuable wealth is in different states, but the Merton model has little
to say about which state variables should be important: in general, any variables affecting
future risk or risk aversion are candidates.1 These would include at a minimum aggregate
demand factors such as the variables governing habit persistence and the aggregate supply
1

In a recent application of the Merton approach, Petkova and Zhang (2005) reasonably pick the expected
market risk premium as the state variable. By conditioning the expected market risk premium on the term spread,
default spread, and lagged risk free rate, they explain a substantial part of the value premium. Santos and
Veronesi (2006) use an income distribution measure as a state variable in a conditional CAPM.

variables affecting productivity. However, insofar as the Merton approach produces a
conditional version of the CAPM, it is also subject to the Lewellen and Nagel (2006)
critique.
A third asset pricing approach focuses on the production side instead of the
consumption side, and makes quite different contributions. Based on the asset pricing
models of Brock (1982) and Lucas (1978), respectively, Balvers, Cosimano, and McDonald
(1990) and Cecchetti, Lam, and Mark (1990) argue that aggregate output is equal or
proportionate to aggregate consumption and that one can evaluate the marginal utility of
consumption at the observed level of output so that aggregate output growth becomes the
key asset pricing factor.2 The advantage to this approach is that output growth is likely
measured more accurately than consumption growth.
A different production-based perspective is provided by Cochrane (1991, 1996), who
explicitly derives an expression for investment returns (using two factors as proxies:
residential and non-residential investment growth) and argues that these can serve as a
pricing kernel for asset returns. Cochrane (1996) ﬁnds that investment returns are
signiﬁcantly priced. Li, Vassalou, and Xing (2006) use a more disaggregated model and
ﬁnd that a four-factor investment-growth approach increases the model ﬁt dramatically.3
In a recent survey article, Cochrane (2005) argues for the production-based approach, as
opposed to the consumption-based approach, stating that ‘‘This approach should allow us
to link stock returns to genuine business cycle variables, and ﬁrms may do a better job of
optimization (more precisely, information and transactions cost frictions which we
abstract from may be less important for ﬁrms)’’ (Cochrane, 2005, p. 33). He then adds that
to date no pure production-based approach has been developed that ‘‘ylinks macro
variables to asset returns independently of preferences’’ (Cochrane, 2005, p.34, italics in
original). The model we develop yields a pure production-based approach in the sense that
the variables determining the pricing kernel characterize the production capacity of the
economy and are not related to preferences.
Theoretically, we can ﬁnd that the pricing kernel prices investment returns based either
on arbitrage, as in Cochrane (1991, 1996), or on ﬁrms’ ﬁrst-order conditions. Thus,
Et ðmtþ1 rItþ1 Þ ¼ 1, where mt is the pricing kernel at time t and rIt is the time-t investment
return for the representative ﬁrm. It follows tautologically that mtþ1 ¼ Ztþ1 =rItþ1 , with

asset pricing.

Peng and Shawky (1999) employ Cochrane’s (1991) approach to study the equity premium but impose an ad
hoc pricing kernel. A recent paper by Jermann (2005) develops a generalized version of Cochrane’s (1991) model
to consider the size of the equity premium.
Additionally, several asset pricing models include a production sector but focus predominately on explaining
the size of the equity premium. Jermann (1998) argues that we need both adjustment costs and habit persistence to
match the observed equity premium. Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher (2001) emphasize limited intersectoral factor
mobility and habit persistence in order to explain several aspects of the equity premium and key facts of the
overall economy. The path-breaking model by Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang (2003) provides a structural theory of
the risk sensitivities of ﬁrms differing by value and size attributes. These approaches focusing on the equity
premium belong to the consumption-based approach, rather than the production-based approach, as they use the
marginal rate of intertemporal substitution (with or without a habit factor) as the pricing kernel.
Kim (2003) provides a different theoretical perspective by using duality theory in Cochrane’s (1996) framework.
Vassalou and Apedjinou (2003) empirically develop a corporate innovation factor—a scaled, ﬁrm-speciﬁc version
of Solow’s residual—showing that this factor, when added to the market factor, absorbs the momentum effect in
cross-sectional asset prices.

Et ðZtþ1 Þ ¼ 1. This motivates taking investment returns to represent the pricing kernel as in
Cochrane (1996) and Li, Vassalou and Xing (2006). However, in principle, other than in
the mean, Zt+1 is unrestricted and may represent any factor affecting the pricing kernel in
addition to investment returns. We relate Zt+1 to shocks in the marginal value of capital,
obtaining an explicit production-based expression for the pricing kernel.
While our paper ﬁts within the third asset pricing approach, it is fundamentally different
from the other production-based asset pricing papers. Essentially, we take advantage of
the fact that in a competitive economy with complete ﬁnancial markets, the marginal rate
of intertemporal substitution is tied to a stochastic version of the marginal rate of
intertemporal transformation. The former is the pricing kernel in the consumptionbased model; the latter becomes the pricing kernel in our model. The factors in the
production-based kernel are easily observable and are given uncontroversially, at least
in the neoclassical tradition, by labor, capital, and productivity shocks. We replace
the consumption-based kernel uc ðctþ1 ; xtþ1 Þ by the production-based kernel Ztþ1 =rItþ1
and ﬁnd that the latter performs very well. Our argument in support of the
CCAPM is thus that it works well, once we circumvent the problems inherent in
measuring marginal utility, uc(c, x), that are bound to occur when we have only a vague
idea of what ‘‘x’’ is.
The assumptions in our model of a perfect competition, complete markets, neoclassical
environment in which supply shocks in the form of productivity shocks are important
bring us close to the canonical version of the Real Business Cycle (RBC) literature. In
addition to supporting the CCAPM, our results may be interpreted as using alternative
evidence, stemming from the cross-section of ﬁnancial returns, on whether productivity
shocks derived from the Solow residual are indeed a key source of macroeconomic
ﬂuctuations. If so, the productivity shocks should be able to explain a signiﬁcant fraction
of cross-sectional variation in asset returns.
In assessing how well the traditional RBC model explains the observed cross-section of
asset prices our work overlaps with that of Zhang (2005), who asks whether a speciﬁc
neoclassical model with asymmetric capital adjustment costs can explain the returns of
value and growth ﬁrms. The approaches are complementary. For instance, our approach
derives the pricing kernel in general equilibrium, endogenously generating the appropriate
risk premiums in the economy, whereas Zhang’s approach calibrates an industry
equilibrium framework with an exogenous pricing kernel, providing a detailed look at
ﬁrm-speciﬁc aspects, endogenously generating risk sensitivities. Further differences are that
we focus on explaining the mean excess return of any ﬁnancial asset, not only the value
premium, and in our speciﬁc explanation of the value premium control for size. Our
approach also allows for conventional evaluation of the model’s performance against that
of alternative asset pricing models. In addition, the results are not contingent on a speciﬁc
parameterization or on the absence of capital adjustment costs; rather they apply to a large
class of RBC models.
The model generates a simple ‘‘productivity-based’’ asset pricing equation with the
aggregate productivity shock as the factor and the current aggregate capital stock and the
productivity level as conditioning variables, capturing in essence the marginal value of
capital. The two state variables appear to be cointegrated, suggesting a parsimonious
version of the model with the cointegrating residual becoming the single state variable. The
parsimonious model produces reasonable estimates for both the level of the productivity
risk premium and its conditional variation and generates a covariance between the

productivity risk premium and the betas of sufﬁcient magnitude to address the
Lewellen–Nagel critique.
The model results are also consistent with a simple Cobb–Douglas aggregate production
function with a productivity parameter in the typical range, although a full-blown
calibration of our general equilibrium model is outside the scope of the paper. The model
also performs extremely well against the leading alternatives, suggesting not only that the
basic RBC framework is consistent with the cross-section of asset returns but also that a
production-based pricing kernel may be preferable in practice to the consumption-based
kernel—presumably because capital and its productivity can be measured more accurately
than the marginal utility of consumption. Furthermore, we check the prediction that a
proper state variable should forecast returns. We ﬁnd that indeed, in the typical forecasting
regressions, the state variable predicts market returns and the value premium well.
Additionally, for the state variable to be priced into expected returns as we ﬁnd, the state
variable forecasts returns nonlinearly, also as predicted.
The strong performance of the model in explaining the return difference among the 25
Fama and French (1996) portfolios sorted by size and value arises because the
unconditional part of the model explains much of the dispersion of mean returns by size
class while the conditional part explains much of the dispersion of mean returns between
value and growth ﬁrms: smaller ﬁrms have higher exposure to productivity risk on average
while for a given size, value ﬁrms are most risky in states in which the productivity risk
premium is higher.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we derive the
conditional asset pricing model that arises from a standard RBC model and discuss the
theoretical implications. Section 3 considers data and methodology. The implications of
the theory are examined in Section 4, which presents the qualitative and quantitative
results and a comparison with competing models. Section 5 concludes.

The lifetime utility of the representative consumer is maximized subject to a standard
production function F(yt,nt,kt), where the inputs are (per-capita) labor nt and capital kt,
and an exogenous technology/productivity level yt. The productivity level is assumed to
follow a Markov process as given by Eq. (4), with et+1 representing the zero-mean white
noise productivity shock. Per-capita consumption is given in Eq. (5) as the part of percapita production that is not invested. The ‘‘time-to-build’’ feature of the model implies
that the capital stock is chosen one period before it becomes productive. Labor can be
adjusted instantaneously.
These assumptions imply that there are exactly two state variables in the model: the
current per-capita capital level kt and the current productivity level yt. Thus, the Bellman
equation in the dynamic programming problem is as given in Eq. (3), where V(kt,yt)
represents the indirect utility function—the maximal lifetime value of utility for the
representative consumer—as dependent on the current state of the economy.
It is possible to generalize the above model substantially without changing the state
variables. In particular, we can add both a time trend and capital dependence to the
evolution of the productivity level in Eq. (4): yt+1 ¼ H(yt, kt t, et+1). This would capture,
respectively, a deterministic trend in productivity and a ‘‘learning by doing’’ effect whereby
a larger capital stock facilitates learning about its productive use (see, for instance, Bahk
and Gort, 1993). Further, investment in Eq. (5) can be replaced by a more general
transformation function, taking capital adjustment costs into account: ct ¼ f(yt, nt,
kt)g(kt+1, kt), where g is increasing convex in kt+1, decreasing in kt, and typically
assumed to be homogeneous of degree one in its arguments. Note that F ðyt ; nt ; kt Þ 
f ðyt ; nt ; kt Þ þ ð1  dÞkt and that without capital adjustment costs g(kt+1, kt) ¼ kt+1(1d)kt,
where d represents the depreciation rate of the capital stock.
With the generalizations, the state variables of the model remain kt and yt. Even the
deterministic trend t does not become an additional state variable if the model’s variables
are properly detrended as shown, for instance, by King and Rebelo (2000, pp. 944–946).
Because these generalizations do not change the state variables, and the productivity shock
et+1 remains the only random variable, the cross-sectional asset pricing implications are
similar. We therefore choose to present the simpler standard RBC model, which allows us
to argue that the standard model alone is adequate for generating strong cross-sectional
explanatory power (resolving the Mankiw–Shapiro issue) and sufﬁciently strong
covariance between the betas and the risk premium (resolving the Lewellen–Nagel issue).
Further, the interpretation of the empirical results does not rely on the existence of
capital adjustment costs. Our approach does not address the equity premium puzzle
(the Mehra–Prescott issue). The simple RBC model may explain the size of the equity
premium, but it is likely that the more general version of the model, with capital
adjustment costs as in Cochrane (1991, 1996) and Zhang (2005), would be essential for
this purpose.

(9)

Thus, from Eqs. (2) and (9) we obtain a production-based pricing kernel as follows:
mtþ1 ¼ Ztþ1 =F k ðytþ1 ; ntþ1 ; ktþ1 Þ;

Ztþ1 ¼ V k ðktþ1 ; ytþ1 Þ=Et ½V k ðktþ1 ; ytþ1 Þ.

(10)

Note that in our context without adjustment costs, we have that the marginal product of
capital Fk(yt+1, nt+1, kt+1) is exactly the investment return rItþ1 and that the marginal rate
of intertemporal transformation (MRIT) equals 1/Fk(yt+1, nt+1, kt+1), differing from the
pricing kernel by a factor Zt+1 with EtZt+1 ¼ 1. The reason that MRIS 6¼ MRIT state-bystate though markets are complete is that there is an intertemporal risk that even under
perfect risk sharing cannot be avoided. In particular, given time to build, the uncertainty
about the productivity shock has real implications that are unavoidable in the aggregate.
Thus, the Zt+1 term represents a fundamental, nondiversiﬁable risk inherent in capital
accumulation that cannot be ignored and should be essential for asset pricing. The
productivity-based pricing kernel therefore consists of two components, namely, the
MRIT term, which accounts for how much additional capital can be physically produced
out of (real) ﬁnancial payoffs, and the Zt+1 term, which accounts for the unanticipated
change in the marginal valuation of this additional capital.
2.2. Variables in the productivity-based pricing kernel
We examine whether the pricing kernel, derived from a model that has been successful in
characterizing key macroeconomic moments, is also useful in pricing the cross-section of
ﬁnancial assets. We focus on the case of excess returns for two reasons. First, since the
kernel is in real terms it prices in real terms and returns need to be corrected for inﬂation.
Rather than using some inﬂation measure we subtract a benchmark asset return that is also
in nominal terms so that the resulting return is automatically adjusted for inﬂation.
Second, the pricing kernel for excess returns (and more generally zero-investment
portfolios) can be simpliﬁed, leading to a more parsimonious factor speciﬁcation.4
The pricing equation for excess returns is
Et ½riE
tþ1 V k ðktþ1 ; ytþ1 Þ=F k ðytþ1 ; ntþ1 ; ktþ1 Þ ¼ 0
4

for all i,

(11)

Based on Cochrane’s (1996) linear conditioning approach the excess returns case leads to a two-factor or a
three-factor conditional model, depending on whether one or two state variables are employed. When real returns
are considered instead, we end up with three or ﬁve factors, respectively. The difference occurs because the state
variables by themselves become factors affecting the unconditional mean level of returns but not excess returns.

412

where in this excess returns formulation we can eliminate the Et ½V k ðktþ1 ; ytþ1 Þ term in the
pricing kernel. It is easy to see that kt+1 depends on the current capital level kt and the
current productivity level yt only, whereas, from Eq. (7), Zt+1 depends on kt+1 and yt+1.
From Eq. (4), the latter depends, in turn, on yt and the shock et+1. Thus,
mEtþ1 ¼ V k ðktþ1 ; ytþ1 Þ=F k ðytþ1 ; ntþ1 ; ktþ1 Þ ¼ Mðkt ; yt ; tþ1 Þ.

(12)

Eq. (12) implies that all returns can be explained by kt, yt, and et+1. Conditional on
information at time t, solely the productivity shock et+1 matters, so this is the single factor
in pricing all assets. However, the extent to which et+1 matters depends on the state of the
economy and is determined by kt and yt.
In principle, the production-based pricing kernel in Eq. (12) should price assets exactly
as well as the consumption-based pricing kernel in Eq. (2). However, as Campbell (1993)
points out, the necessary consumption data may not be measured well and, as we argue
above, the consumption-based kernel may include additional mysterious ‘‘x’’ variables that
are not easily identiﬁed. Thus, application of the consumption-based pricing kernel is not
straightforward.
Accordingly, we propose evaluating the usefulness of the production-based kernel
empirically. While others have looked at production-based asset pricing, their work is
methodologically very different. Balvers, Cosimano, and McDonald (1990) and Cecchetti,
Lam, and Mark (1990) merely replace consumption by output and do not consider crosssectional asset pricing implications. Cochrane (1996) and Zhang (2005) impose a particular
production-based pricing kernel exogenously.5
2.3. The conditional beta expression
Assume that all returns and the productivity shock are jointly conditionally
normally distributed. This assumption is not essential but is sufﬁcient to allow us to
linearize the pricing kernel. From Eqs. (11) and (12), using the deﬁnition of covariance,
we have
i

(13)

Using Stein’s Lemma (which applies given the conditional multivariate normality
assumption), we then have
Et ðriE
tþ1 Þ ¼

Covt ðritþ1 ; tþ1 Þ,

(16)

Cochrane (1996) explicitly derives an expression for investment returns and then assumes that a subset of the
investment returns is a good approximation for the pricing kernel.

Eq. (16) implies a ‘‘mimicking’’ linear pricing kernel that prices all zero-investment asset

If we construct a zero-investment position with unit sensitivity to the productivity shock,

Applying Eq. (18), it is given as

where the white noise properties of et+1 imply that the unconditional variance of et+1

We focus empirically on the unconditional implications of this conditional model.
Taking unconditional expectations in Eq. (16), we obtain

(21)

where bt ¼ b(kt, yt), bit ¼ Covt ðritþ1 ; tþ1 Þ=Varðt Þ, and RPt ¼ bt s2 from Eq. (19). The
unconditional mean excess return consists here of an unconditional part and a conditional
part. The unconditional part is the premium based on the productivity risk and the asset
risk sensitivity in the average state. The conditional part arises because of correlation
between the productivity risk premium and an asset’s productivity beta, that is, its
sensitivity to the productivity shock. If an asset’s productivity risk exposure is high (high
bit ) when the risk premium is low (bt closer to zero), then the covariance between the risk
premium and the beta is negative, subtracting from the asset’s overall riskiness and
producing a negative conditional return component.
2.4. Return and factor stationarity
Accepting theoretical and empirical arguments that asset returns are (second-order)
stationary, the pricing kernel must be stationary as well. Eq. (20) implies that b(kt, yt) must
be stationary in order for the second moments of returns to be stationary. This may occur
in two different cases. Either both kt and yt are trend stationary (i.e., given the potential
model interpretation in terms of detrended variables, these variables are stationary once a
time trend has been removed) or both kt and yt are nonstationary but cointegrated so that
we may write
_

bðkt ; yt Þ ¼ b̄ðst ; yt Þ ¼ b ðst Þ ¼ b0 þ b1 st ,

(22)

where by deﬁnition st is the stationary cointegrating residual of a regression of kt on yt and
a constant. The ﬁrst equality follows tautologically whereas the second equality implies a

ARTICLE IN PRESS
414

restriction that must hold if the pricing kernel is to be stationary. Eq. (22) then allows us to
generate a singular state variable that is sufﬁcient to capture the state of the economy and
is found as the cointegrating residual based on the two original state variables. The third
equality holds because, for empirical purposes, we take a ﬁrst-order approximation around
the mean of the state st, with b0 and b1 constant.
2.5. Implications
The signs of the parameters in the linearized pricing kernel, substituting Eq. (22) into
Eq. (17), can be determined by straightforward comparative statics analysis based on
Eq. (12). The signs are formally ambiguous because of the typical opposing income
and substitution effects. For instance, the effect of a change in et+1 in Eq. (12) depends on
how et+1 affects the marginal value of capital for the indirect lifetime utility of the
representative consumer compared to how capital affects current production at the
margin. Both effects are positive and are difﬁcult to compare quantitatively. From Eqs. (8)
and (12) we may instead look at how et+1 affects ct+1. Here the opposing effects are more
intuitive: one effect is a direct increase in production for given inputs, leading via the
income effect to higher consumption and a lower marginal utility of consumption, and the
second effect is the substitution effect of investment becoming more productive, causing
consumption to fall for given production.
If the investment elasticity is not too large then the income effect dominates so that
higher et+1 is associated with higher ct+1 and lower marginal utility of consumption.6 This
implies that b0 is negative: excess returns are discounted more strongly (valued less) in the
face of productivity risk because a positive shock leads to more consumption and a lower
marginal evaluation of returns. The factor risk premium for productivity risk is then
positive from Eq. (19) and assets that load heavily on the productivity shock factor require
high average returns.
However, the investment elasticity ﬂuctuates with the state of the economy, which
explains the role of the state in affecting asset prices. In general the effect of the state
variable is complex and difﬁcult to assess a priori. Anticipating that the cointegrating
regression yields a positive link between kt and yt (because a higher productivity level leads
eventually to a higher capital stock), a positive cointegrating residual, capturing the state st
of the economy, indicates a surplus of kt relative to yt. This surplus may be viewed as an
excess of tangible capital relative to intangible capital. Investment (in tangible capital) will
generally be low in this state but a given positive productivity shock et+1, enhancing
intangible capital, may well have a larger impact on the marginal value of capital when
intangible capital is relatively scarcer, that is, st is higher, inducing more investment.
Investment becomes more sensitive and, accordingly, consumption less sensitive to et+1.
Thus, productivity shocks have less impact on the marginal utility of consumption, making
them less risky. In this scenario we expect b1 to be positive, so that an increase in the state
variable implies that b(kt, yt) is closer to zero. The risk premium on the productivity factor
therefore varies over time, with increases in the state of the economy mitigating the role of
productivity risk on consumption and lowering the productivity risk premium.
6

To simplify the intuitive discussion, we ignore here the effect that leisure has on the marginal utility of
consumption. A positive productivity shock leads to increased labor demand and less leisure. This may increase or
decrease the marginal utility on consumption depending on whether leisure and consumption are substitutes
or complements.

Given Eq. (22), Eq. (21) can be written as a more explicit two-factor model, with factors
stet+1 and et+1 and intercept a:



0
1
iE
iE
E riE
tþ1 ¼ a  b Cov tþ1 ; rtþ1  b Cov st tþ1 ; rtþ1 .

(23)

From the theory we expect to ﬁnd a ¼ 0, b0o0, and b140. In addition to the slope
coefﬁcients, the intercept is important since a positive (say) intercept implies that the risk
factors systematically underpredict the mean returns of individual assets, or, in other
words, that quantitatively the risk premiums are too small to explain the mean level of
excess returns. A nonzero intercept can also be interpreted as the model’s pricing error
in pricing any zero-beta asset (its excess return theoretically should be zero but it is
predicted to be a).
An additional implication is that, in principle, based on Eq. (23) the factors stet+1 and
et+1 explain all of the cross-sectional variation in unconditional mean asset returns. Thus,
the cross-sectional ﬁt is an important criterion for determining the adequacy of the model.
In evaluating the cross-sectional ﬁt we use the adjusted-R2 calculated from the actual and
predicted returns. The adjusted-R2 is more appropriate than Hansen’s (1982) JT statistic if
the question is not so much whether the asset pricing model used is actually the true model
but instead whether the model explains a large fraction of cross-sectional differences in
asset returns.
Eq. (21) provides a quantitative check on the importance of the state variable. Lewellen
and Nagel (2006) raise the issue that estimating the parameters of a linear pricing
kernel to best-ﬁt a particular set of mean asset returns does not exhaust the empirical
implications because, while the coefﬁcients are set to match cross-sectional variation, there
is no guarantee that the coefﬁcients quantitatively match the magnitude of the covari
ance between  beta and the risk premium across states. From Eq. (21), dE riE
tþ1 =
dCov RPt ; bit ¼ 1.
A further unconditional implication of the model follows from the fact that the
pricing kernel for assets must also price aggregate investment returns: the pricing kernel in
Eq. (10), mtþ1 ¼ Ztþ1 =F k ðytþ1 ; ntþ1 ; ktþ1 Þ, implies that Et ½mtþ1 F k ðytþ1 ; ntþ1 ; ktþ1 Þ ¼ 1
because Et Ztþ1 ¼ 1. This relation allows us to establish whether the pricing kernel
that we identify empirically implies quantitatively appropriate investment returns.
Speciﬁcally, if we make the typical assumption of a Cobb–Douglas production function,
then we have F k ðytþ1 ; ntþ1 ; ktþ1 Þ ¼ aðytþ1 =ktþ1 Þ þ 1  d. To consider excess returns
subtract Et ½mtþ1 ð1 þ rftþ1 Þ ¼ 1, where rftþ1 is the real risk-free rate. It follows that
a ¼ E½mtþ1 ðd þ rftþ1 Þ=E½mtþ1 ðytþ1 =ktþ1 Þ, which we can compute given the empirical time
series for the pricing kernel.
We also consider empirically two conditional implications of the model. In addition to
the productivity risk premium, the sensitivities of individual asset returns to the
productivity shock generally should be time-varying as well because, depending on the
particular asset, the state of the economy also affects how the productivity shock impacts
particular ﬁrms and industries. As in Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b),7

We have that riE

This implies that, if the state has an important impact on unconditional mean returns
(b1 not equal to zero), then not only should the state forecast future returns (as emphasized
by Campbell (1996), Ferson and Harvey (1999), Lettau and Ludvigson (2001a), and Santos
and Versonesi (2006), following Merton (1973)), but it should do so quadratically. From
Eqs. (16), (22), and (24) we obtain

Since the state forecasts next period’s mean returns, it should be correlated with future
realized returns. Taking unconditional expectations in Eq. (25) because E(st) ¼ 0 it follows
that mean returns depend on their state sensitivities through the quadratic term only. The
state variable st forecasts returns and does so quadratically if the conditional variable is to
explain mean return differences. Although we make speciﬁc linearity assumptions this
implication illustrates the more general principle that any effect of state variables on
unconditional mean returns must result from nonlinearities. Given b1 is positive, ﬁrms i
with positive bi1 exhibit lower mean returns since their positive loading on stet+1 implies
that their productivity risk is highest when the productivity risk premium is lowest.
3. Empirical preliminaries
The model implies that asset returns are determined by one systematic factor, the
aggregate productivity shock, with the cointegrating residual measuring the size of the
capital stock relative to the productivity level as the conditioning variable. We discuss next
the methodology and the data used to evaluate the model.
3.1. Methodology
The method employed is mostly the one-stage generalized method of moments (GMM)
estimation of Hansen (1982). We focus on one-stage GMM estimation because, as
recommended by Altonji and Segal (1996), Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b), and Cochrane
(2001), Hansen’s optimal weighting matrix is poorly estimated when the cross-section of
test assets is large relative to the time series of data, which is the case in our sample.
Jagannathan and Wang (2002) show that the stochastic discount factor (pricing kernel)
approach is as efﬁcient as the expected return-beta approach and that it has higher power
in detecting model misspeciﬁcations. Furthermore, one-stage GMM estimation enables us
to focus on economically interesting portfolios. We follow Cochrane (2001) and formulate
asset returns in terms of the pricing kernel and apply one-stage GMM to ﬁnd the pricing
kernel’s loadings on the risk factors. With these loadings, we then compute the implied risk
premiums.8 To evaluate the overall statistical signiﬁcance of the model, we rely on
Hansen’s (1982) JT statistic.
3.2. The data
Our main test assets are the 25 portfolios sorted by market capitalization and book-tomarket ratio. The returns for these assets are available from Kenneth French’s website.
8

The risk premiums using one-stage GMM are very close to those obtained by the Fama and MacBeth (1973)
method.

Fig. 1. Mean returns and factor levels. Fig. 1a displays the average excess returns of the 25 portfolios sorted by
size and book-to-market ratio. The return data are from Kenneth French’s website. Figure 1b shows per capita
capital and productivity. These data are normalized by subtracting the overall mean and dividing by the standard
deviation. The data start at 1964Q1 and end at 2004Q4.

To construct excess returns, we subtract the (nominal) three-month T-bill rate. Fig. 1(a)
illustrates the unconditional mean returns of the portfolios separated by size (market
capitalization) and value (book-to-market ratio).
We construct the productivity level, yt, following King and Rebelo (2000)9. In the
aggregate production function, labor inputs have a weight of two-thirds and capital has a
share of one-third. We obtain Population, Labor Hours, Gross Domestic Investment, and
Capital data directly from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Other data are from the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Our sample starts 1964Q1, restricted by the limited
availability of data on labor hours, and ends 2004Q4. Quarterly capital stock data are
interpolated from annual data using quarterly investment data and the annual capital
stock measure, with year-end 1963 as the starting point: for each quarter a fraction of the
annual capita increment is added to the current end-of-year stock, with the fraction given
as the year’s investment to date divided by total investment. We employ per-capita data
throughout, dividing by population.
Following King, Plosser, Stock, and Watson (1991) the productivity shock et+1 for the
case in which yt and kt are cointegrated is obtained by ﬁrst differencing log yt+1 and then
subtracting the mean. We ﬁnd that the shock thus constructed is correlated with both
lagged state variables yt and kt. Hence, to whiten the shock, we regress it on these variables
[or, with virtually identical results on the cointegrating residual st, as suggested by Sims,
Stock, and Watson (1990)] to obtain the random productivity shock.10 The regression
results are in Table 1, which also presents further summary statistics for the factor and
9

Due to data availability, alternative (and less common) measures for productivity shocks [for example,
Jorgenson and Stiroh (1999), and Basu, Fernald, and Shapiro (2000)] or productivity shocks adjusted for capital
utilization are not considered.
10
We make the correction solely to obtain an asset pricing factor that is appropriately random. The dependence
on kt suggests that formally Eq. (4) should be changed to add kt on the right-hand side to incorporate a learningby-doing effect. However, this would have no impact on the theoretical results. In addition, whether or not we
correct the shock for the correlation with the lagged variables has a negligible effect on the empirical results that
follow.

state variable. Fig. 2 displays the time series. Both series ﬂuctuate around a mean
of zero and show no time trend. The state variable is highly persistent. The productivity
shock shows no persistence but may have some conditional heteroskedasticity that we
disregard.
For the no-cointegration case, when the productivity level is presumed trend stationary
we adjust kt for a linear time trend and obtain et+1 as the residual from regressing (in logs)
yt+1 on yt, a constant, and a linear time trend as in King and Rebelo (2000).11
Fig. 1(b) depicts the two state variables yt and kt (standardized by subtracting their
means and dividing by their standard deviations) over the sample period. Both variables
are clearly nonstationary and appear to be cointegrated as is expected theoretically from
King, Plosser, Stock, and Watson (1991) when the productivity level is not stationary.
Table 1 displays the results of formal unit root and cointegration tests. The Augmented
Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests for a unit root indicate that a unit root cannot be rejected for
either state variable. Proceeding under the assumption that both state variables have a
stochastic trend we next check if the trends are cointegrated. The Johansen tests provide
clear evidence that the state variables are indeed cointegrated although this is not so clear
from the ADF test. In the following we use as our main speciﬁcation the formulation with
the cointegrating residual as the single state variable.
11

Using instead the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) ﬁlter to adjust for the time trend or adding kt in the regression to
whiten the residual has no appreciable impact on the empirical results.

4. Results
In this section we provide empirical results for the performance of the productivitybased models in both the cross-sectional and time series dimensions. We then compare
these models against standard alternative asset pricing models.
4.1. The conditional and unconditional productivity-based models
We ﬁrst discuss the unconditional one-factor productivity-based asset pricing model and
then, in more detail, a conditional two-factor model, and ﬁnally a conditional three-factor
version of the model.
4.1.1. The one-factor (unconditional) model
Table 2 and Fig. 3 report the results for the unconditional and conditional versions
of our model. The unconditional version follows from Eq. (20) under the assumption
that bt is constant or from Eq. (23) assuming that b1 ¼ 0. The GMM estimation based on

Table 2
GMM one-stage estimates for the productivity-based models
We report the pricing kernel loadings on the systematic factors (the bi parameters), the implied risk premiums,
their traditional (Fama-MacBeth, 1973), Shanken (1992) corrected, and autocorrelation-consistent t-values,
Hansen’s JT statistics, and implied R2s. PROD is the unconditional productivity model; PROD-s uses the
cointegrating residual s between k and y as the conditioning variable; and PROD-ky includes the two state
variables k and y, each adjusted for a linear time trend. The data are from 1964Q1 to 2004Q4.

unconditional productivity model, Fig. 3b uses the cointegrating residual s between k and y as the conditioning
variable, and Fig. 3c includes both state variables k and y, each after subtracting a linear time trend. The data are
from 1964Q1 to 2004Q4. The two-digit numbers denote the Fama–French 25 portfolios. The ﬁrst digit refers to
the size quintile (from 1, small, to 5, large) and the second digit refers to the book-to-market quintile (from 1, low
book-to-market, to 5, high book-to-market). The ﬁgures display the ﬁt for all models by showing the deviations of
each test asset’s return from that predicted by the model. This deviation is the one-stage GMM pricing error
discounted by the expectation of the stochastic discount factor. If there is no pricing error, the actual return equals
the predicted return so that all plots locate on the 45-degree line.

returns in our sample are 9.4% on an annual basis. With average productivity betas
estimated around 4.4, the productivity risk implies an average annual excess return of
approximately 4  4.4  0.36% ¼ 6.3%. The unconditional model, however, has a
second-pass alpha of 0.77%—3.1% annualized—and a cross-sectional ﬁt (R2) of only
18.2% (see Fig. 3). The JT statistic based on the pricing errors strongly rejects the model
with a p-value of 0.000.
4.1.2. The two-factor (conditional) model
In contrast to the one-factor model, the conditional version of the model in Eq. (23)
performs well. The GMM estimation gives b0 ¼ 224.4 and b1 ¼ 438.36 with the expected
signs, implying a quarterly productivity risk premium of 0.87% and a conditional risk
premium of 0.51%. The Fama–MacBeth t-statistics are signiﬁcant at 3.12 and 2.62,
respectively; the Shanken t-statistics, are 1.40 and 1.17, respectively.12 The crosssectional ﬁt is 71.5% as shown in Fig. 3 and the JT statistic is 28.85, implying that the
model cannot be rejected statistically (p ¼ 0.15). The model’s alpha is 0.47%, which is
statistically insigniﬁcant and less than 2% annualized. Given a mean productivity beta of
3.9 and a mean conditional factor beta of 3.0, productivity risk implies an average annual
excess return of 13.6% and the conditional factor implies an average annual excess return
of 6.1%. In total, the alpha, unconditional risk, and conditional risk premium add up to
1.9+13.6 – 6.1 ¼ 9.4%, which is also (as required statistically) the annual equal-weighted
mean excess return in our sample.
4.1.3. Conditional and unconditional risk components of the two-factor model

Therefore it shows that the size premium is explained by differences in average exposure

conditional factor betas than value ﬁrms so that, given size and the negative conditional
factor risk premium b1 Varðt ÞVarðst Þ, mean returns on value ﬁrms exceed those
of growth ﬁrms. Note that conditional factor exposure also explains part of the size
premium.
Table 3 lists the individual excess return components for the 10 assets consisting of ﬁve
size and two value classes. For each size class the unconditional return components of
growth and value ﬁrms in Panel B are quite similar, whereas for each size class the
conditional return components of value ﬁrms are at least 1% per quarter more and on
average 1.23% more than those of growth ﬁrms in Panel C. This compares reasonably well
to the actual value premiums for each size class in Panel A, which are always positive,
varying from 0.49% to 2.75%, with an average of 1.54%.
From Panels B and C the model implies an average size premium (between small and
big) of around 1.13% which is similar to that in the actual data in Panel A of 0.98%.
12

As Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b) and Santos and Veronesi (2006) point out, the Shanken correction in the
t-statistics appears to be more severe for macro factors. Fama–MacBeth t-statistics are also reported because
Jagannathan and Wang (1998) show that the Fama–MacBeth procedure may understate rather than overstate the
precision of the standard errors under conditional heteroskedasticity.

Fig. 4. Decomposition of the excess returns. We decompose the excess returns into their unconditional—upper
left panel—and (the negative of) their conditional risk premium—upper right panel—components for the 25
portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market ratio. The lower left panel shows the sum of the unconditional and
conditional return components and the lower right panel shows the actual mean returns of the 25 portfolios.

However, the actual data (see Fig. 1 or Table 3, Panel A) indicate a size premium of 2.10%
for value ﬁrms and 0.15% for growth ﬁrms, whereas our model implies a size premium
that is similar, around 1.20%, for both value and growth ﬁrms.
4.1.4. Discussion of the two-factor model results: the conditional risk premium
The negative value for b0 implies an average positive risk premium of b0 Varðt Þ. One
explanation for the positive productivity risk premium is that positive (negative)
productivity shocks coincide with high (low) consumption availability and accordingly
low (high) marginal valuations of returns. Assets with positive sensitivity to the
productivity shock generate low (high) returns when the marginal valuation of these
returns is high (low) and are thus risky, requiring a higher mean return. Alternatively put,
an increase in et+1 affects (lowers) the marginal utility of consumption. This would occur
typically when the positive productivity shock raises production but does not increase
investment by so much as to offset the increased production, so that in total consumption
increases and the marginal utility of consumption falls.

However, the strength of the productivity shock impact on investment depends on the
state: the higher is st, the larger is the capital stock in relation to its productivity, which
affects the incentive to invest. The positive value for b1 that obtains implies that the
productivity risk premium falls as the state variable st increases. This must occur because a
larger part of a production shock is offset by a change in investment causing consumption
and marginal utility to be more stable, which is necessary for a smaller risk premium. The
positive value of b1 and its explanation raise a few questions, namely, does investment
sensitivity to productivity shocks increase with the state and, if so, what may be the reason?
To address whether, indeed, an increase in the state raises the investment sensitivity to
the productivity shocks, we regress (gross) aggregate investment growth against the
relevant variables from our model.13 Panel H in Table 1 shows that the average
productivity shock elasticity is around one and that the coefﬁcient on the state variable is
signiﬁcantly negative. The latter negative sign is expected as a higher state corresponds to a
lower marginal product of capital. More to the point, investment’s productivity shock
elasticity increases signiﬁcantly with the state as evidenced by the positive sign on the crossproduct of the state and the productivity shock. Quantitatively, the regression result of
Panel H in Table 1 implies that a one standard deviation change in the state, from Panel A
in Table 1, changes the elasticity by 1.023  0.56 ¼ 0.57%. Thus, as the state rises from one
13
Investment includes both nonresidential and residential investment. Results are qualitatively similar, but
weaker, when we consider these components separately. The explanatory variables are the state variable, the
productivity shock, and their interaction. Note that the state variable does not appear by itself as a determinant of
ﬁnancial asset returns or investment returns since we consider excess returns, causing the predetermined factor to
drop out.

standard deviation below to one standard deviation above average, the investment
elasticity to the productivity shock increases from 0.41 to 1.55.
To complete the intuitive discussion of the positive sign of b1 we discuss a possible
reason for the investment elasticity to the productivity shock to increase in the state
variable. Essentially, st is a measure of the abundance of tangible capital (the capital stock
kt) relative to intangible capital (the productivity level yt). In a ‘‘capital abundant’’ state
(when tangible capital is high relative to intangible capital) a positive productivity shock
contributes to the relatively scarce intangible capital, closing part of the gap and raising the
marginal value of tangible capital to a relatively large degree, which increases investment
incentives substantially. In a ‘‘capital scarce’’ state (when tangible capital is low relative to
intangible capital) a positive productivity shock contributes less as intangible capital
already is abundant and so investment increases little. Note that a capital abundant state
by itself implies low investment (since the marginal product of capital is low), as we ﬁnd
empirically in Table 1, Panel H. However, it is the component of investment in response to
the unanticipated productivity shocks that affects the consumption risk.
An alternative intuition for why investment elasticity to the productivity shock increases
with the state variable is that capital abundance indicates a situation in which the marginal
value of (tangible) capital is currently low. Thus, production has less value at the margin,
which is equivalent to the (shadow) price of current investment being lower. Now a
positive productivity shock, raising both future productivity and current output in an
environment in which investment is ‘‘cheap’’ may well lead to a larger aggregate
investment response, even when capital is currently abundant. Similarly, when capital is
scarce, expansion is expensive so that a positive shock may have only a small impact on
investment.14,15
4.1.5. Discussion of the two-factor model results: the value and size premium
From an empirical perspective, why does our conditional productivity-based model
explain the value and size-sorted portfolio means better than an unconditional
productivity-based model and as well as the Fama–French three-factor model designed
speciﬁcally to explain these mean returns? The unconditional excess return component is
positive for all test assets—all have positive exposure to the productivity factor on average.
However, there is a clear pattern in that smaller ﬁrms have considerably higher sensitivity
to the productivity shock. Thus, the unconditional component does well in explaining the
size effect.
The conditional component is negative for all test assets. It represents the fact that, for all
assets, Covt ðtþ1 ; riE
tþ1 Þ—the excess return’s sensitivity to the productivity shock—is higher
when the state of the economy st is higher. But a higher state implies a smaller risk
premium on the productivity factor, so expected excess returns are lower as Eq. (23)
14
These intuitions may not apply if, instead of absence of adjustment costs, the more realistic assumption of
irreversibility of investment is made. With irreversibility the investment elasticity to the productivity shock may
become zero at a high enough value of the state variable (capital abundance) when this situation represents an
unplanned excess of capital.
15
A possible alternative explanation for a negative effect of the state variable on the productivity risk premium
is that the variance of the productivity shock decreases with the state. To check this we regress the square of the
productivity shock on the (lagged) state variable. The effect is close to being statistically signiﬁcant (Newey-West
t-values of 1.76 and 1.79) but the direction of the effect is opposite: if anything, the productivity shock variance
increases in the state.

implies. The key observation in Fig. 3 is that the reduction in the mean excess returns
based on the conditional component is largest for growth ﬁrms. Therefore, the conditional
component does well in explaining the value premium: on average growth ﬁrms are about
as sensitive to productivity shocks as value ﬁrms, but their sensitivity is high for states in
which the risk premium is low and consequently they require a lower expected return on
average than value ﬁrms.
Zhang (2005) also addresses the value premium focusing on productivity shocks as the
risk factor. The value premium in his paper exists because value is riskier than growth
when the productivity risk premium is high. In this sense Zhang’s account coincides with
ours. His interesting explanation is that, due to asymmetric costs of adjustment, in bad
times value ﬁrms face extra risk since they cannot dispose of their excess capital without
considerable cost. This explanation conﬂicts with our empirical results in two ways when
we consider changes in the productivity level (Zhang’s state variable and a component of
our state variable). In Zhang’s model a lower level of productivity raises the risk premium
and increases productivity betas more for value ﬁrms than for growth ﬁrms. In our model a
lower level of productivity lowers the risk premium and increases betas more for growth
ﬁrms than for value ﬁrms (see the productivity betas provided in Table 4). We believe that
the discrepancy is related to the omission of capital from Zhang’s pricing kernel (and thus
from his deﬁnition of the state). The inclusion of capital is extremely important. One
indication is the empirical importance of capital when it is separated from the productivity
level in our three-factor model in Table 2. Additionally, capital moves positively over time
with the productivity level (the cointegrating relationship), and the productivity level itself
may be nonstationary—reasons why Zhang’s results may be misleading as to the impact of
the productivity level in isolation. Further, the difference in the betas of value and growth
stocks is likely affected by the aggregate capital stock since ‘‘assets in place’’ for which
capital is a proxy have a different degree of importance for value ﬁrms compared to growth
ﬁrms.
4.1.6. Endogenous factor sensitivities: an informal analysis
All assets have a positive unconditional excess return. Given the negative value for b0
this implies that on average all assets load positively on productivity risk. This is intuitive
because a positive aggregate productivity shock should directly beneﬁt most ﬁrms. Table 3
also shows that all assets have negative conditional excess return components. This implies
from Eq. (21) or (23) that, for instance, a state with a lower risk premium on et+1 is
associated with all assets having higher sensitivity to et+1 (the productivity betas are higher
in a capital abundant state), or put differently, the ﬁrm betas on the conditional factor are
all positive. Our exposition takes the betas as exogenous but would be more complete if the
systematic movements of betas with the state were also explained. Here our macro-based
model is at a disadvantage relative to the recent contributions of Gomes, Kogan, and
Zhang (2003) and Zhang (2005), who provide speciﬁc models of how factor sensitivities
change over time for classes of ﬁrms. We can speculate as to plausible causes for the
differences in factor exposures that explain the size and value premiums in a way that is
consistent with the model, but our formal model is not designed to explain these
differences.
View ﬁrms as convex combinations of two projects, one with immediate payoff and one
an option on a technology with future payoff (a growth option). Value ﬁrms emphasize the
former project; growth ﬁrms the latter. A higher current value for the state implies lower

Table 4
The productivity risk premium and productivity betas by state
We distinguish four states: a high capital scarcity state (State 1: s more than one standard deviation below the
median), moderate capital scarcity (State 2: s below the median), moderate capital abundance (State 3: s above the
median), and a high capital abundance state (State 4: s more than one standard deviation above the median).
Results are reported for the growth and value portfolio productivity betas for each state and for their difference.
In addition, the table provides the covariance of the portfolio’s productivity betas with the productivity risk
premium. The LL approach (Panel A) computes the betas for each state using Eq. (24) while the LN approach
(Panel B) computes the betas using a two-pass regression for each state separately.

investment costs (current and, likely, future), increasing the value of the growth option. At
the higher state, a productivity shock just when investment is cheap may have a stronger
effect on growth option returns, but this is difﬁcult to assess without a formal model.
However, if the productivity shock does have a stronger impact on the growth option
return, then all ﬁrm productivity betas vary directly with the state but those of growth
ﬁrms vary more than those of value ﬁrms. This is the pattern that we observe. This
explanation does not rely on adjustment costs and hence is consistent with a narrow
interpretation of our model. Table 4 (both panels), discussed more thoroughly in a
following section, shows clearly that the productivity betas for all ﬁrms increase as the state

improves, and for all size classes, the increases are substantially larger for growth ﬁrms
than for value ﬁrms.16 A formal examination of these issues awaits future research.
4.1.7. Investment returns in the two-factor model
Given an aggregate Cobb–Douglas production function f ðyt ; nt ; kt Þ ¼ yt ðkt Þa ðnt Þ1a
we can impute the production function parameter from a ¼ E½mtþ1 ðd þ rftþ1 Þ=
E½mtþ1 ðytþ1 =ktþ1 Þ. To compute the Solow residual we use the standard calibration of
a ¼ 0.33. Matching the aggregate investment return series to the pricing kernel with
quarterly depreciation set to d ¼ 0.025 instead implies a ¼ 0.24. Thus, while there is some
discrepancy, it appears that our model implies a reasonable value for the Cobb–Douglas
production function parameter that is in the ball park of the range of values usually
considered for the parameter. (For instance, DeJong and Ingram (2001) obtain a ¼ 0.23.)
Put differently, the two-factor model also prices investment returns quite well.
4.1.8. The three-factor (conditional) model
For completeness we present the results of the three-factor model that arises if we do not
account for possible stochastic trends and cointegration between the two state variables kt
and yt. Here we detrend the state variables using linear deterministic trends (results for HP
ﬁlters are similar). Calculation of the productivity shock then involves a regression of the
Solow residual in levels on its lag. It is straightforward to show that assuming bðkt ; yt Þ ¼
b0 þ b1 yt þ b2 kt in Eq. (20) directly implies the three-factor model

The results for this model are similar to the two-factor case (see Table 2 and Fig. 3).
Since compared to the three-factor model the two-factor model is more parsimonious, with
explanatory power at least as good, we emphasize the two-factor model in the following.
4.1.9. Efficient estimation with fewer test assets
The estimation has employed one-stage GMM estimation mostly because Hansen’s
optimal weighting matrix is poorly estimated when the cross-section of test assets is large
relative to the time series. However, because the 25 Fama–French portfolios have an
approximate factor structure, much of the cross-sectional dispersion can be captured by
only a few portfolios provided they are sufﬁciently different in value and size
characteristics. Accordingly, we use as alternative test assets the excess returns of just
the four portfolios constituting the HML and SMB factors, available from Kenneth
French’s website. The advantage is that Hansen’s optimal weighting matrix can now be
well estimated, allowing for efﬁcient parameter estimation by two-stage GMM.
The results of two-stage GMM estimation for the four test assets are presented in
Table 5, Panel A. The parameter estimates are impressively similar to the 25 asset case for
16
An alternative explanation for this observation may be that ﬁrms increase ﬁnancial leverage as
(collateralizable) capital becomes more abundant when the state increases, causing equity betas to increase. If
this effect is more important for growth ﬁrms their betas increase more. Table 4 also shows that small ﬁrms have
substantially higher betas in all states than larger ﬁrms. One reason small ﬁrms have higher productivity factor
loadings may be because they tend to be of more recent vintage. That is, they may rely more on recent technology
or be more dependent on new opportunities or niches; each of which is sensitive to productivity/technology
ﬂuctuations.

Robustness of the estimation results for the three productivity-based models
Panel A presents the two-stage GMM estimation results for the productivity-based models for four value- and size-sorted test assets. The four assets are the valueﬁrm, growth-ﬁrm, small-ﬁrm, and large-ﬁrm portfolio returns available from Kenneth French’s website. Panel B displays the one-stage estimation results for the
1964–1992 sample period for the 25 value- and size-sorted portfolio returns. PROD is the unconditional productivity model; PROD-s uses the cointegrating residual
s between k and y as the conditioning variable; and PROD-ky includes the two state variables k and y, each adjusted for a linear time trend. The data are from 1964Q1

each of the three model speciﬁcations. Focusing on the two-factor conditional model, we
ﬁnd a risk premium of 0.88% for the productivity factor compared to 0.87% in the 25 asset
case and a risk premium of 0.62% for the conditional factor compared to 0.51% in the
25 asset case, with similar t-statistics. It is not sensible to consider the R2s for the four asset
case, but the JT statistic for the pricing errors, which adjusts for the degrees of freedom,
reﬂects the improved estimation efﬁciency, implying a large p-value of 0.55 compared to a
p-value of 0.15 in the 25 asset case.
4.1.10. Estimation results for the pre-1992 time period
The original study by Fama and French establishes the value factor as a preeminent
inﬂuence on asset pricing for data up to 1992. To conﬁrm that our results explain the value
effect and are not unduly inﬂuenced by the extreme returns of the 1990s we omit this
period and consider only the 1964–1992 estimation period. Panel B of Table 5 shows that
the results for the reduced sample period are close to the full sample results for each of the
three model versions. For instance, the two-factor conditional model implies a risk
premium of 0.88% for the productivity factor, versus 0.86% for the complete sample
period, and a risk premium of 0.41% for the conditional factor, versus 0.51% for
the complete sample. The adjusted-R2 is 51% compared to 72% for the full period.
The t-statistics are a little lower in accordance with the reduced sample size.
4.2. The importance of the state variable
The conditional model improves dramatically on the unconditional productivity-based
model. However, the state variable being important has two alternative implications, not
directly related to the cross-sectional ﬁt, that we evaluate in this section. First, Campbell
(1996) and others argue any state variable explaining cross-sectional return differences
must be useful in forecasting future returns in a time-series context. Second, Lewellen and
Nagel (2006) argue the quantitative effect of the state variable in explaining cross-sectional
return differences must be of the same magnitude as the covariance between the risk
premium and the asset’s beta as in Eq. (21).
4.2.1. Forecast power of the state variable
Following Merton (1973), Campbell (1996), Ferson and Harvey (1999), Lettau and
Ludvigson (2001a), and Santos and Veronesi (2006) show that the state variables in their
asset pricing models forecast market (excess) returns. To provide additional, independent
evidence on the importance of the cointegrating residual as a state variable, we consider its
forecasting properties. As Campbell (1996, p. 342) notes, ‘‘yvariables that spuriously
explain the crosssection are unlikely to be the same as variables that spuriously forecast the
time series.’’ Since the state variables are generally quite persistent, Fama and French
(1988) and others argue that the forecast for a moving sum of the market return is normally
better as this improves the signal-to-noise ratio compared to forecasting a single market
return realization. The dividend-price ratio (Fama–French, 1988), the cay variable (Lettau
and Ludvigson, 2001a), and the share of labor income (Santos and Versonesi, 2006) all
have signiﬁcant forecasting power for market returns.
We consider these forecast regressions for our state variable, with a few differences. The
ﬁrst is minor: we divide the moving sum of the market return by the number of terms to
obtain the moving average. This standardizes the coefﬁcient, making it easier to interpret

We predict next-quarter MKT and HML based on current s and s2 and report the coefﬁcients, Newey-West and
Hodrick (1992) type I-B t-values, and the adjusted-R2. Panel A uses s as the only forecasting variable. Panel B uses
both s and s2 as forecast variables. *Denotes that estimates are signiﬁcant at the 5% level for a one-tailed test

the results. Second, since we explain the value premium based on the conditional factor,
the return on the zero-investment portfolio long on value ﬁrms and short on growth ﬁrms
(‘‘HML’’) should also be forecastable by the state variable. Third, the theoretical model
implies necessarily that the link between market returns and the forecast variable is
quadratic. This issue has been ignored in previous papers but is essential: if the state
variable explains unconditional mean return differences it must have an important
nonlinear component. From Eq. (25) it follows that since the state has zero mean,
unconditional mean differences arise only via the quadratic term. Since all assets have
positive sensitivity to the conditional factor and since b1 is positive, from Eq. (25) the
square of the state variable should have a negative effect on the future market return, that
is, the link between the state variable and the future market return should be U-shaped.
Similarly, since by our explanation of the value effect the zero-investment portfolio loads
negatively on the conditional factor, the square of the state variable should have a positive
effect on the future return difference between value and growth portfolios.
Table 6 demonstrates that, indeed, the state variable has some forecasting power
for market excess returns (S&P 500 returns including dividends, available from
Robert Shiller’s home page, net of the quarterly T-Bill return), especially for the longer
horizons. The R2 for only the state as the explanatory variable is 9% and 14% for a

one-quarter-ahead forecast of the three- and four-year moving averages of market excess
returns, with a signiﬁcantly negative Newey-West t-statistic for these horizons. When we
add the square of the state as an additional forecast variable the coefﬁcient on the square is
negative as predicted for all but the three and four-year horizons, but is signiﬁcant only for
the one-quarter horizon.17 For the HML variable, the explanatory power of the state
variable is similar. The R2 is 9% and 13% at the three- and four-year horizons when the
state is the forecast variable; when we add the coefﬁcient for the square of the state variable
it is positive as predicted and has a signiﬁcant Newey-West t-statistic for all but the fouryear horizon.18
4.2.2. Cyclicality of excess returns
Excess returns move countercyclically under decreasing relative risk aversion in the
endowment economies of Chen (1991) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999): as
consumption gets closer to the subsistence or habit level in a recession, risk aversion
and required excess returns increase. Empirical conﬁrmation of this pattern is found in
Harrison and Zhang (1999) for excess returns and in Tallarini and Zhang (2005) for
real returns. They ﬁnd that predicted market returns (excess and real) are higher during
NBER-classiﬁed recession periods.
In our production economy, a more complex link between excess returns and the
business cycle surfaces. The state variable relates negatively to the productivity risk
premium and excess returns (the positive value of b1) because in a capital-abundant state
investment reacts more and consumption varies less in response to a productivity shock.
So, as the state variable increases, consumption risk diminishes, implying that the
productivity risk premium falls unambiguously. However, the state variable has an
ambiguous link to the business cycle as measured by aggregate production. If the state
variable rises due to an increase in the capital stock, aggregate production rises and
excess returns are countercyclical; if the state variable rises due to a fall in the productivity
level, aggregate production falls, ceteris paribus, and excess returns are procyclical. Fig. 2
shows that based on the NBER recession classiﬁcation the state variable often peaks
during recessions, suggesting initially that excess returns are mostly procyclical in our
model.
To provide more perspective Table 7 provides correlations between our state variable
and key variables tied to the business cycle and excess returns. We consider three groups of
variables: standard information variables known to forecast returns, business cycle
measures, and future market returns. The state variable is uncorrelated with the term
premium but has signiﬁcant negative correlation with the dividend-price ratio and the
default risk premium. As is also clear from Fig. 2, the state variable has signiﬁcant
positive correlation of 0.45 with a dummy variable that takes the value of one during
NBER-classiﬁed recessions and a negative correlation with a continuous business cycle
variable (the level of real GDP minus its 12-quarter-lagged moving average to adjust for
trend). The state variable has a negative correlation with one-quarter and 12-quartersahead cumulative returns, conﬁrming the forecast regression results in Table 6.
17
Signiﬁcance is at the 5% level for a one-tailed test. The adjusted-R2s for the period after 1992 average 50% for
the eight-quarter, 12-quarter, and 16-quarter moving average returns, implying that the model does well in
explaining the ‘‘bubble’’ of the 1990s. Nevertheless, even for the 1964–1992 period the adjusted-R2s for the eightquarter, 12-quarter, and 16-quarter moving average market returns are 7–11%.
18
The Hodrick (1992) type I-B t-statistics are somewhat lower in all cases as reported in Table 6.

Given conventional measures of the business cycle, our state variable is generally
countercyclical. Hence, the productivity risk premium is procyclical and in turn (because
productivity risk betas are generally positive) predicted market returns are procyclical. From
the perspective of our model, however, aggregate production f(yt, nt, kt) is not the best
business cycle measure. A better business cycle measure is production plus usable capital,
which captures aggregate consumption availability (literally in our model without adjustment
costs): F(yt, nt, kt)  f(yt, nt, kt)+(1d)kt. This is consistent with Black (1990), who ﬁnds that
aggregate wealth, not production, has a countercyclical link to the risk premium: it is not just
current production that matters for consumption opportunities, but also the part of previous
production levels saved in the form of capital. The correlation of production plus usable
capital with the state variable is a signiﬁcant 0.58 as shown in Table 7. It follows that excess
returns are typically procyclical if we measure the cycle by aggregate production but are
countercyclical if we measure the cycle by consumption availability. While the two are
identical in a Lucas endowment economy, this is not so in a production economy. Presuming
correctness of our model, standing empirical results of countercyclical expected excess returns
for the aggregate production measure may be due simply to the signiﬁcant positive
correlation of 0.46 between aggregate production and the consumption availability measure.
The conventional business cycle measures also imply low correlations with future market
returns and an unintuitive procyclical default risk premium of 0.14 (which is a
countercyclical 0.31 for the production plus usable capital measure, not shown in
Table 7). In addition to the negative correlation with the market risk premium, Table 7
shows that our state variable also has a large signiﬁcant negative correlation of 0.59 with
the default risk premium. The reason may be that, in addition to the productivity risk
directly affecting the default risk premium, an increase in the state represents an increase in
tangible capital relative to intangible capital, raising ﬁrms’ collateral and lowering the
default risk premium. Thus, our model provides a more subtle relationship between cycle
and excess returns because the relevant state variable does not have a one-dimensional tie
to aggregate production.
4.2.3. Magnitude of the conditional effect on returns
To characterize more fully the effect of the state on returns we discretize the state space
and consider four different regions for the state variable: more than one standard deviation

ARTICLE IN PRESS

below the median, between zero and one standard deviations below the median, between
zero and one standard deviation above the median, and more than one standard deviation
above the median. We then ﬁrst use the Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b) method to compare
the productivity risk premium and the productivity betas across these four state regimes.
The Lettau-Ludvigson method ﬁnds for states i ¼ 1,y, 4 the average risk premiums in
each state and the betas given by Eq. (24), bisðiÞ ¼ bi0 þ bi1 sðiÞ. We can then ﬁnd the
covariance across the four states between the risk premium and the beta, yielding the
conditional premium for each asset. Table 4 provides the results, conﬁrming our earlier
discussion that the extent of the (negative) covariance between the risk premium and the
beta explains a signiﬁcant part of the value premium.
This approach is subject to the Lewellen–Nagel critique, however. The problem is that
the magnitude of the coefﬁcients is based on maximizing the cross-sectional ﬁt with no
regard to matching the actual covariance between the risk premium and the betas.
Lewellen and Nagel’s solution is to estimate betas over short time windows and correlate
these with realized risk premiums over the short windows. Since we have only quarterly
data, this approach is not feasible as is. Instead we provide an approximation by
considering a discrete number of four state regimes and estimating betas in addition to
obtaining average risk premiums for these regimes. By this approach we implicitly set the
variation within a state equal to zero. We can decompose the covariance into that from
between-state variation and that from within-state variation:
CovðRP; bÞ ¼ E½CovðRP; bÞjs þ Cov½EðRPjsÞ; EðbjsÞ.

(27)

Thus the between-state covariance estimate we obtain is a lower bound to the actual
covariance. Given a monotonic covariance between the risk premium and the betas,
excluding the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side decreases the (absolute) magnitude of the
total covariance.
To obtain a numerical value for the last term in Eq. (27) we estimate four productivity
betas for each asset, one for each of the state regimes, and ﬁnd the productivity risk
premium for each state regime. We can then ﬁnd the covariance between the risk premium
and the beta for all 25 assets. Impressively, the covariance is negative in all cases. Table 4
shows that, as for the LL approach, the risk premium varies directly by state going from
0.98% in the worst state (s is more than one standard deviation below the median) to
0.18% in the best state (s is more than one standard deviation above the median).
Although there is no theoretical reason for the risk premium to be positive, we ﬁnd no
evidence of a systematically negative risk premium.
Table 4 also shows quite clearly that betas rise mostly monotonically from the worst
state to the best state and that this effect is more pronounced for growth ﬁrms than for
value ﬁrms. Most importantly, when we calculate the (lower bound of the) quantitative
value for the covariance for value ﬁrms and growth ﬁrms in each size class, this covariance
in Panel B of Table 4 is always negative and more so for growth ﬁrms, explaining a positive
value premium for each size class that on average is around 56% of the value premium in
each size class estimated in the model as shown in Panel D of Table 3 and around 44% of
the observed value premium as shown in Panel A of Table 3. The shortfall can plausibly be
attributed to the fact that our four-state approximation ignores the within-state
covariation—the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (27). We conclude that the
covariance between the productivity risk premium and productivity betas is quantitatively

Fig. 5 and Table 8 show that the cross-sectional ﬁts of the productivity-based model and
the investment-based model are similar, around 20%, and signiﬁcantly higher than for the

Fama–French model can be interpreted as a version of the Merton model. Two recent
conditional consumption-based models are included: the Lettau and Ludvigson (2001a, b)

display the ﬁt for all models by showing the deviations of each test asset’s return from that predicted by the model.
This deviation is the one-stage GMM pricing error discounted by the expectation of the stochastic discount factor.
If there is no pricing error, the actual return equals the predicted return so that all plots locate on the 45-degree
line.

‘‘cay’’ model and the Campbell and Cochrane (1999) habit persistence model. In addition
we consider our productivity-based two-factor conditional model using Eq. (23).
Table 9 shows that our model has the lowest JT statistic, substantially lower than that of
any of the other models, including the Fama–French model. Fig. 6 provides the adjustedR2, which is 71.5% for our model compared to 77.6% for the Fama–French model. The
Lettau-Ludvigson and Campbell–Cochrane models have R2s of 46.1% and 40.4%,
respectively. The alphas for the productivity-based conditional model and the cay model
are statistically insigniﬁcant and relatively low at 0.48% and 0.15%, respectively. The
alphas for the Fama–French and Campbell–Cochrane models are statistically and
economically signiﬁcant, however, at 3.92% and 2.07%, respectively.
4.4. Model evaluation
A recent paper by Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2006) argues that the cross-sectional
ﬁt of the 25 Fama–French portfolios sorted by size and value presents a rather low hurdle
for the evaluation of an asset pricing model. They contend that when portfolios have an
approximate factor structure, as is the case for the 25 Fama–French portfolios, the pricing
errors are idiosyncratic (not pervasive) and not likely to be correlated with the factors of a
particular asset pricing model; rather, in that case, even a weak correlation between the
model factors and those generating the test portfolios would imply that the model betas are
linearly related to the ‘‘true’’ betas, automatically generating a high R2.
In the following we discuss the prescriptions suggested by Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken
(LNS) to provide alternative ways to evaluate asset pricing models. First, LNS suggest
adding Fama and French’s 30 industry portfolios to the 25 size and value portfolios and
using these assets jointly to test a model in order to relax the tight factor structure of the
size-value portfolios. Table 10 provides the results for the three variants of our model and
the conditional models. In each case the R2 deteriorates signiﬁcantly. Both of our
conditional models hold up relatively well, with R2s for our two-factor and three-factor
models of 22.8% and 33.1%, respectively, compared to 31.5% for the FF model and much
lower for the other models.
Isolating the performance for the 30 industry portfolios, we present the root mean
square error of these portfolios implied by the parameter estimates for the 55 test assets.
These are relatively similar for all models, varying from 0.75% for the Campbell–Cochrane
model to 0.81% for the Fama–French model. Along this dimension, all three of our
productivity-based models outperform the Lettau–Ludvigson and Fama–French models
but underperform the Campbell–Cochrane model. The relatively strong performance of
the unconditional productivity-based model here is likely due to the fact that it does worse
than the conditional models in explaining the 25 size and value-sorted portfolios so that
the parameter estimation can emphasize ﬁtting the 30 industry portfolio returns without
giving up much explanatory power. A possible explanation for the poor performance of all
models in explaining the average industry returns is the occurrence of persistent
idiosyncratic industry-speciﬁc shocks: with hindsight certain industries decline while
others emerge. If the trends are not discernible in advance, average returns cannot fully
represent risk factors.
Second, LNS advocate checking whether the estimated slopes and intercept are
reasonable. We ﬁnd that the alpha in our two-factor model is economically reasonable,
implying a quarterly mispricing of zero-beta assets of 0.48%, which is lower than that for

all other models except the cay model. In addition, the alpha is statistically insigniﬁcantly
different from zero, even when the 30 industry portfolios are added as test assets. Note that
for the FF model the alpha is economically as well as statistically signiﬁcant, with a
quarterly alpha exceeding 3%. Earlier we discussed the reasonability of the unconditional
and conditional factor premium estimates, arguing in particular that the size of the
conditional factor risk premium is related to the magnitude of the covariance between the
beta and the risk premium. The coefﬁcients decrease in magnitude when the 30 industry
portfolios are added but this is in line with the overall degradation in performance of the
model.
Third LNS propose including the model’s factors among the test assets. Since our
factors are not returns we use a slightly different approach and evaluate our two-factor
conditional model’s performance in pricing the investment return for the representative
ﬁrm. We ﬁnd that the model implies a production function parameter of 0.24, which is
relatively close to the typically assumed value of 0.33.
As ﬁnal prescriptions LNS suggest reporting conﬁdence intervals for the cross-sectional
R2 and for the squared pricing errors measure. We present the 90% conﬁdence intervals for
the R2 and for the JT statistic in Table 10. The conﬁdence intervals for both are based on
the distribution of the statistic, for a particular group of test assets, obtained in 5,000
draws of the appropriate number of multivariate normally distributed factors. The interval
reported contains the 90% of R2s around the median. Table 10 shows that only the R2s of
our two-factor model and the FF model exceed the 90% conﬁdence interval. When the
industry test assets are added none of the models have R2s outside of the interval. Results
for the JT statistic are similar: except for our two-factor model, no models have JT
statistics outside of the 90% conﬁdence interval based on random factors. For the 55 asset
case, our two-factor model has a JT statistic below the 90% conﬁdence interval, indicating
that the pricing errors are signiﬁcantly smaller than for a random factor model.
In addition to the LNS prescriptions we consider several other diagnostics that illustrate
the reasonability of our productivity-based model. To summarize, we show not only that
the magnitude of the conditional factor risk premium is sensible but more speciﬁcally
that the risk premium decreases state-by-state as the state improves over the four regimes
we distinguish (Table 4). The state variable signiﬁcantly forecasts future excess returns on
the value factor and the market return in the direction predicted by theory. And, most
importantly, the factors are exactly those implied by theory for general speciﬁcations of the
standard RBC model.
5. Conclusion
We study the cross-section of asset returns from the production side of the economy and
argue that asset returns are determined by a one-factor model with one conditioning
variable. The factor is the aggregate productivity shock et+1, the impact of which is
conditional on the state of the economy st. In the context of our model—a standard RBC
model—the state of the economy as it pertains to asset prices is fully characterized by the
relative scarcity of capital, that is, the level of the existing capital stock (tangible capital) in
comparison to productivity (intangible capital).
In general terms, we replace a consumption-based pricing kernel with a productionbased kernel, employing a stochastic link between the marginal rate of substitution and
the marginal rate of transformation according to which uc ðctþ1 ; xtþ1 Þ ¼ mðtþ1 ; st Þ, where

x may be a variety of variables, each potentially affecting the marginal utility of
consumption,
The empirical results strongly support our production-based model compared to
existing theoretical models in the literature, and are competitive empirically with the
Fama–French three-factor model. Thus, the cross-section of asset prices provides support
for the canonical RBC model from a different perspective. Furthermore, it appears that the
speculated improved measurement from using production variables instead of consumption variables does indeed provide a better characterization of the cross-section of asset
prices.
The explanations for the mean returns of the challenging 25 Fama–French test assets
sorted by size and value is that small ﬁrms have higher mean returns than large ﬁrms
mostly because their average sensitivities to productivity risk are higher. Value ﬁrms have
higher mean returns than growth ﬁrms, in spite of having approximately the same average
sensitivity to productivity risk, because the risk premiums and risk sensitivities vary with
the capital stock and productivity level: as the state variable (capital stock relative to
productivity level) increases, the risk premium falls while risk sensitivities to the
productivity shock increase. But compared to value ﬁrms the risk sensitivities of the
growth ﬁrms increase more rapidly with the state so that growth ﬁrms have their highest
risk when the productivity risk premium is low (or even negative), implying lower returns
on average. The reason that growth ﬁrms are more sensitive to changes in the state may be
that the effective price of investment varies inversely with the state. Thus, growth ﬁrm
values vary more dramatically with productivity shocks in a capital abundant state, as
positive shocks are enhanced with low investment costs enabling these ﬁrms to realize their
growth potential cheaply.
The consumption-based approach has had difﬁculty explaining the size of the equity
premium, mean return differences across asset classes, and the low covariance between
betas and risk premiums. Our production-based approach deals successfully with the
second issue, by explaining a substantial fraction of cross-sectional return variation from
productivity shocks and a conditional variable, and with the third issue by generating a
covariance between productivity shock betas and the risk premium across state regimes
that is sufﬁcient to explain quantitative differences in returns across asset classes.
While the model is effective in explaining cross-sectional differences, we do not address
the ﬁrst issue, the equity premium puzzle, and, more generally, we do not ask whether the
overall level and volatility of observed returns can be generated by a model of this kind.
This requires a speciﬁc functional form for the marginal value of capital function, which in
turn, requires a full speciﬁcation of the general equilibrium model. But one of the
advantages of our approach is precisely the ability to avoid making such speciﬁc
assumptions: our results hold independent of functional forms, relying simply on the key
variables underlying basic RBC models. Nevertheless, under the assumption that the
CCAPM has generally failed to meet the three challenges because of the incorrect
speciﬁcation of the x factor affecting marginal utility, we see no reason why a proper
functional form for the marginal value of capital function would not resolve the equity
premium puzzle. For starters, ﬁtting the aggregate investment return provides a reasonable
value for the capital share in production for the basic Cobb–Douglas production function.
It may be the case that quantitatively the factor sensitivities needed to explain the crosssectional return variations are unrealistically high (or low for that matter). However, we
present the simplest RBC model to emphasize that only this simple model is needed to

explain the cross-sectional results. It is possible to change the investment function to allow
for adjustment costs, changing the form of the marginal value of capital function without
changing the variables, namely, the productivity factor and the state variable. This would
allow the market price of capital to vary, generating return volatility supplementing that
due to productivity shocks. Finding an investment cost function (with or without
adjustment costs) in the context of a fully calibrated general equilibrium model that implies
a realistic equity premium and return volatilities presents an interesting direction for future
research.
