Abstract
We investigate the proﬁtability of technical trading strategies based on an asymmetric
reverting property of stock returns. We identify an asymmetry in return dynamics for daily
returns on the S&P 500 index. Return dynamics evolve along a positive (negative) unconditional mean after a prior positive (negative) return. The trading strategies based on this asymmetry generate a positive return for buy signals, a negative return for sell signals, and a
positive return for the spread between buy and sell signals. Our results imply that the observed
asymmetry in return dynamics is the main source of proﬁtability for the implied strategies,
thereby corroborating arguments for the usefulness of technical trading strategies.

1. Introduction
Various studies have documented the proﬁtability of technical trading strategies.
The usefulness of these strategies in equity markets relies on the presumption that
proﬁtable patterns in market prices can be identiﬁed and will continue in the future.

Hence, technical analysis must be able to predict movements in market prices based
upon identiﬁable patterns. 1
Brock et al. (1992) showed that simple technical trading rules based upon the
movements of a short-run and a long-run moving average have predictive ability
with regard to a century of daily data on the Dow Jones industrial average. They
found that buy signals consistently generate positive returns and sell signals lead
to negative returns. Using bootstrap simulations of various null equilibrium pricing
models, they also show that proﬁts from the technical trading rules are not adequately explained by the popular parametric models for the return generating process. 2
According to the moving average rules, buy and sell signals are produced by the
relationship between a short-period and a long-period moving average. A buy (sell)
signal occurs when the short-period moving average is above (below) the long-period
moving average. There are numerous variations of this basic strategy, such as introducing a band width around the moving average or changing the length of the shortand long-period. The trading range break-out rule triggers a buy (sell) signal if the
stock price moves above (below) a resistance (support) level.
Numerous studies on technical trading employ moving average rules. Several recent studies, however, examine the proﬁtability of technical trading rules based upon
Neural Network models. For example, Gencßay (1998a) and Fernandez-Rodrıguez
et al. (2000) used Neural Network models to determine buy and sell signals and
showed that this technical trading rule is always superior to a na€ıve buy-and-hold
strategy. Also, using feedforward network and nearest neighbors regressions, Genay and Stengos (1997, 1998) found that simple technical trading rules have a significant predictive power in forecasting returns.
Interestingly, Gencßay (1998b) and Gencßay and Stengos (1997) found evidence of
nonlinear predictability of buy and sell signals in forecasting daily returns on the
Dow Jones industrial average. Most bootstrap tests on the proﬁtability of technical
trading rules assume a linear dynamic relationship for the returns process and fail
to explain the source of proﬁtability. For example, Brock et al. (1992) did not consider
nonlinearity in return dynamics for the bootstrap simulations of the four popular null
models. They did indicate that the linear autoregressive models for the conditional
mean process failed to explain the proﬁtability of the technical trading rules. However,
they mentioned that the result of positive (negative) buy (sell) returns indicate the existence of an asymmetric nature in return dynamics, and nonlinear models incorporating asymmetric dynamics might explain the source of proﬁts. Thus, these studies
suggest that the return generating process is better characterized by nonlinearities,
and technical trading rules exploiting nonlinearities may generate positive returns.
There is growing interest in the nonlinear stochastic process of return dynamics.
Several recent studies indicate that predictable components of stock returns are

Many studies have examined the proﬁtability of technical trading rules for the currency market
investments (see Olson, 2004; LeBaron, 1999; Gencßay, 1999; Kho, 1996; Taylor and Allen, 1992).

Using UK data, Hudson et al. (1996) show that technical trading rules do not generate excess aftertransaction proﬁts.

stochastically nonlinear and better explained by an asymmetric dynamic process. Speciﬁcally, Nam et al. (2001, 2002) identify an asymmetry property of US stock market
returns. They show that positive returns tend to persist longer than negative returns.
Thus, momentum generally lasts longer for upward trends in the market. Sarantis
(2001) found an asymmetry in annualized returns for the G7 countries’ market
indices. Also, Koutmos (1998), Sentana and Wadhwani (1992), and LeBaron (1992)
explore nonlinearity in autoregressive processes of high frequency return series.
Our preliminary examination of daily S&P 500 market index returns overwhelmingly aﬃrms an asymmetric reverting pattern. For daily returns over the entire period of 01/03/29–12/31/98, there were 798 ﬁve-consecutive-day rises as compared to
only 476 ﬁve-consecutive-day declines; 1506 four-consecutive-day rises as opposed
to only 990 four-consecutive-day declines; 2859 three-consecutive-day rises as opposed to only 2089 three-consecutive-day declines; and 5356 2-day rises against
4311 2-day declines. Similar to the patterns in Nam et al. (2001, 2002), this asymmetry indicates that a positive return is likely to persist longer than a negative return. 3
Based on these ﬁndings, it is reasonable to hypothesize that (a) the dynamic process
of index returns is better characterized by nonlinearity induced from an asymmetric
reverting property, and (b) the asymmetric reverting property of stock returns can be
used to generate proﬁtable technical trading strategies before transaction costs.
Our paper focuses on a possible link between the asymmetric dynamic process of
stock returns and proﬁtable technical trading strategies. The primary objective of
this study is to determine whether the predictable asymmetry in return dynamics
can be used to develop proﬁtable technical trading strategies.
We ﬁnd that daily returns exhibit an asymmetric dynamic process in responding
to prior positive and negative returns. More importantly, the asymmetric stochastic
pattern of stock returns can be exploited to yield above average investment returns.
The trading rules used to identify market positions are controlled by the holding-period return over a prior number of days and also by the number of consecutive days
with the same positive or negative return. 4
Our standard tests indicate that the strategies exploiting asymmetric reverting
patterns generate proﬁtable buy and sell signals. 5 Results show that most of the
strategies implemented generate a positive return for buy signals and a negative
return of sell signals. These results are consistent even when breaking the sample into
two sub-periods.

entire period and two sub-periods.

It should be noted that typically the terms ‘‘momentum’’ and ‘‘contrarian’’ are used for the portfolio
trading rules. The corresponding terms for a single stock or an index trading are ‘‘positive feedback’’ and
‘‘negative feedback’’ trading. Positive feedback traders buy a speciﬁc stock when its price rises, while
negative feedback traders buy a speciﬁc stock when its price falls. Thus, these terms are somewhat
interchangeable; positive feedback trading is a momentum-type strategy and negative feedback trading is a
contrarian-type strategy. For more details on the momentum and contrarian strategies (see DeBondt and
Thaler, 1985, 1987; Jegadeesh, 1990; Lehmann, 1990; Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993, 2001).
5
It should be noted that proﬁtable buy and sell signals implies potential proﬁtability, which reﬂects that
we do not consider transaction costs in our analysis.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents various nonlinear autoregressive models that are implemented to capture various asymmetric reverting patterns in return dynamics. Section 3 provides estimation results of the models and
interpretations. Section 4 discusses various technical trading strategies implied from
the observed asymmetry patterns and reports empirical results concerning the predictability of these strategies. Our concluding remarks are provided in Section 5.

2. Asymmetric reverting patterns
Initial tests on daily returns of the S&P 500 market index show a strong asymmetric pattern in return dynamics. Positive returns tend to persist longer than negative
returns. Table 1 shows preliminary results of asymmetry that is apparent by looking
at consecutive 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, and 5-day positive versus negative return series.
Also, for 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, and 5-day holding periods, the number of positive return periods is larger than the number of negative return periods in each case. For
daily returns over the entire period of 01/03/29–12/31/98, there were 798 ﬁve-consecutive-day rises as compared to only 476 ﬁve-consecutive-day declines; 1506 fourconsecutive-day rises as opposed to only 990 four-consecutive-day declines; 2859
three-consecutive-day rises as opposed to only 2089 three-consecutive-day declines;
and 5356 two-consecutive-day rises against 4311 two-consecutive-day declines. The
asymmetry is also apparent in the two sub-periods shown in Table 1.
An asymmetric pattern in return dynamics cannot be captured by the conventional autoregressive models restricted by the constant serial correlation coeﬃcient.
Capturing the asymmetry requires a nonlinear autoregressive speciﬁcation that

The numbers for positive and negative ﬁgures are based upon overlapping periods for both consecutive

counted as 2 cases of two-consecutive-positive daily returns. Also, there are few zero m-days holdingperiod returns in our samples, which are not included in return patterns in this table.

allows the coeﬃcient on the serial correlation term to change in response to a prior
positive or negative return pattern for a certain horizon. To capture the asymmetric
pattern in return dynamics, we specify the following ﬁve models of nonlinear, autoregressive processes for a stock return, Rt :

Each model represents a nonlinear ARðmÞ model for m ¼ 1; . . . ; 5, and allows
both constant term and serial correlation coeﬃcients to vary in response to prior positive and negative return patterns. To implement the ﬁve models, we deﬁne four different cases of prior return patterns: Case PH-m (Case NH-m) denotes the patterns
of asymmetry identiﬁed under the previous m-day positive (negative) holding period
return. Case PC-m (Case NC-m) denotes the patterns of asymmetry identiﬁed under
prior m-consecutive positive (negative) day returns.
There are ﬁve models to be estimated for each of four cases, and the condition
that satisﬁes mt ¼ 1 determines the corresponding model to be estimated. For example, Case PH-3 represents a prior 3-day holding period return, and mt ¼ 1 only if the
previous 3-day holding period return, deﬁned as Rt1 þ Rt2 þ Rt3 , is positive. 6 The
corresponding model to be estimated is Model 3 under the PH-m Case. Likewise, for
the NC-3 Case (asymmetry identiﬁed under the prior 3-consecutive negative daily returns), mt ¼ 1 only if Rt1 < 0, Rt2 < 0, and Rt3 < 0. Note that Case PH-1 and Case
NH-1 are identical to Case PC-1 and Case NC-1, respectively.
6

Appendix A provides conditions for mt ¼ 1 for all four cases.

For eachP
case, return serial correlation is measured by i¼1 /i þ i¼1 qi under
m
mt ¼ 1 and i¼1 /i under mt ¼ 0 for all ﬁve models. For example, the return serial
correlation for the PH-3 Case is measured by /1 þ /2 þ /3 þ q1 þ q2 þ q3 under a
positive 3-day holding period return and by /1 þ /2 þ /3 otherwise. For the NC-3
Case the return serial correlation is measured by /1 þ /2 þ /3 þ q1 þ q2 þ q3 under
the prior 3-consecutive negative daily returns and
P by /1 þ /2 þ /3 otherwise. Thus,
asymmetry in return dynamics is captured by mi¼1 qi 6¼ 0, which represents additional predictive power for the return estimating process. The sum of autocorrelation
coeﬃcients under each model reveals either persistence or reversion information of
return dynamics using the prior return patterns.
Once an autoregressive process of a return series is identiﬁed for mt ¼ 0 and 1, its
unconditional mean implied by the autoregressive process canPbe calculated. The imm
plied unconditional
of Rt under each model is c0 =ð1  i¼1 /i Þ for mt ¼ 0 and
Pm meanP
m
ðc0 þ c1 Þ=½1  ð i¼1 /i þ i¼1 qi Þ	 for mt ¼ 1. For example, the unconditional mean
for Case PH-2 can be derived as c0 =½1  ð/1 þ /2 þ q1 þ q2 Þ	 under a positive 2-day
holding period return and c0 =½1  ð/1 þ /2 Þ	 otherwise.
It is not surprising that under an asymmetric autoregressive process, return
dynamics evolve with a diﬀerent unconditional mean. The importance of asymmetry
is that it not only enhances the predictability of returns, but it also provides information on the proﬁtability of the implied technical trading strategy. It should be noted
that, while predictability is measured by the autoregressive coeﬃcients, proﬁtability
is analyzed by the unconditional mean.
Predictability, however, does not imply proﬁtability of the implied strategy. An
objective of this paper is to examine the proﬁtability of the implied trading strategy
for each of the four cases. Suppose that the unconditional mean return is positive
under mt ¼ 1 for the PH-2 Case and negative under mt ¼ 1 for the NH-2 Case. 7 This
implies that one can expect, on average, a positive return after a positive 2-day holding period return and a negative return after a negative 2-day holding period return.
The possible payoﬀ of these strategies is that the PH-2 Case generates a positive return, and the NH-2 Case generates a negative return.

3. Estimations
3.1. Data descriptions
The daily return series of the S&P 500 market index from 01/03/29 to 12/31/98 is
used for estimation. We divide the full-period into two sub-periods (9306 observations for each sub-period). The ﬁrst sub-period covers 01/03/29–01/16/62, and the

7

Since Case PH-m and Case NH-m have a mirror image, the condition mt ¼ 0 under Case PH-m is the
same as mt ¼ 1 under Case NH-m. However, this is not the case for the Case PC-m and the Case NC-m,
where asymmetry is identiﬁed with the prior consecutive return patterns.

second sub-period covers 01/17/62–12/31/98. Sub-period analysis is performed to insure that empirical results are not dominated by an atypical period.
Table 2 reports the descriptive statistics of daily nominal returns of the index for
the entire period and two sub-periods. It shows that daily returns exhibit excess
kurtosis and a signiﬁcant autoregressive process for the full-period and both subperiods. While the ﬁrst and second autocorrelation coeﬃcients, qð1Þ and qð2Þ, are
statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level for all sample periods, the third order autocorrelation coeﬃcient, qð3Þ, is not signiﬁcant. Also, except for the second sub-period,
the fourth order autocorrelation coeﬃcients are statistically signiﬁcant at the 1%
level based upon the estimated Bartlett standard deviation. The sum of autocorrelation coeﬃcients is positive for all three periods. This indicates that daily return
dynamics of the index exhibits a persistence, which implies that a positive (negative)
return tends to be followed by another positive (negative) return. It should be noted
that the constant autocorrelation coeﬃcient does not describe the asymmetric property of the return process, which is reported in Table 1.
3.2. Estimation results and interpretations
Table 3 shows estimation results of Models 1–5 for the entire period. Daily returns exhibit strong asymmetry. Positive returns are likely to persist longer than negative

the PH-m Case, and mt ¼ 1 for a prior negative m-day holding-period return under
the NH-m
Pm Case. w0 is the sum of asymmetry autocorrelation coeﬃcients, i.e.,
w0 ¼ i¼1 qi , 8 which adds additional predictive power. F -STAT denotes the F -statistics for the null hypothesis w0 ¼ 0, i.e., no asymmetric reverting pattern. All F -statistics are statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level, except for Model 5 which is
signiﬁcant at the 5% level. Thus, each of the ﬁve nonlinear autoregressive models
have strong explanatory power for the asymmetric reverting components of returns
identiﬁed with a prior positive and negative holding-period return pattern.
w1 measures
Pm the sum
Pm of autocorrelation coeﬃcients under mt ¼ 1 for each model,
i.e., w1 ¼ i¼1 /i þ i¼1 qi . Thus, for the PH-m Cases, w1 measures return serial correlation under a prior positive m-day holding-period return. For the NH-m Cases, w1
measures return serial correlation under a prior negative m-day holding-period return. The results indicate that index returns exhibit positive serial correlation under
a prior positive m-day holding-period return and negative serial correlation under a
prior negative m-day holding-period return. In other words, positive and negative returns tend to persist.
l1 ð¼ ðc0 þ c1 Þ=ð1  w1 ÞÞ denotes the unconditional mean return for mt ¼ 1. The
results show l1 > 0 for the PH-m Cases and l1 < 0 for the NH-m Cases; a positive
unconditional mean under a prior positive holding-period return and a negative
unconditional mean under a prior negative holding-period return.
Panel B in Table 3 shows the estimation results of Models 1–5 for the PC-m Cases
and the NC-m Cases, where the asymmetry is identiﬁed by prior m-consecutive positive or negative daily returns. For the PC-m Cases, mt takes a value of 1 with prior
m-consecutive positive daily returns, while for the NC-m Cases, mt takes a value of 1
with prior m-consecutive negative daily returns. The F -statistics for testing the null
hypothesis of w0 ¼ 0 are all statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level, except for Model
4 in the PC-m Case which is signiﬁcant at the 5% level. However, the reported values
of w0 and w1 in the PC-m Cases does not conﬁrm the desirable result of w0 > 0 and
w1 > 0 (persistence of a positive return). Except for Model 1, all models under the
PC-m Cases show inconsistent results. The result under the NC-m Cases is consistent
with w0 < 0 and w1 < 0. Panels A and B indicate that in general the desirable asymmetry is not well identiﬁed with the prior consecutive daily return pattern, but rather
is better captured by the prior holding period return pattern.
Table 4 reports parameter estimates for the two sub-periods. Panels 1 and 2 show
the results for the ﬁrst and second sub-periods. Panels 1A and 2A display the estimation results for the PH-m Cases and the NH-m Cases. Panels 1B and 2B report the
results for the PC-m Cases and the NC-m Cases. The results indicate that the returns
have strong asymmetric reverting patterns in the autoregressive process with some
variation in the magnitude of parameter estimates. More importantly, for all PHm Cases and PC-m Cases, l1 > 0, and for all NH-m Cases and NC-m Cases,

The sum of autocorrelation is
i¼1 /i under mt ¼ 0 and

i¼1 qi under mt ¼ 1. Thus,
i¼1 qi ¼ 0 indicates no asymmetry in return dynamics.

l1 < 0. Thus, there is a positive unconditional mean return for a prior positive return
and a negative unconditional mean return for a prior negative return.
In sum, there are several notable ﬁndings: (a) Daily returns exhibit a strong asymmetric pattern with positive returns persisting longer than negative returns. (b) The
asymmetric reverting pattern is better identiﬁed with a positive or negative prior
m-day holding-period return pattern than with a prior positive or negative m-consecutive daily return pattern. (c) The unconditional mean return implied from the asymmetric nonlinear autoregressive models is positive under a prior positive return and
negative under a prior negative return. Finding (c) provides an important clue about
the proﬁtability of our trading strategies. The result indicates that taking a long position after a recent positive price change is likely to yield a greater proﬁt before
transaction costs than taking a short position after a recent negative price change.
This ﬁnding is consistent with the results reported in Table 6, which show a positive
return for buy signals and a negative return for sell signals.
3.3. Out-of-sample test
Predictive performance of the nonlinear ARðmÞ model is examined out of sample.
Following the method by Gencßay (1998b), we perform out-of-sample tests on 19 subsamples. Each of the ﬁrst 18 sub-samples contains 1000 observations, and the 19th
one includes 612 observations. 9 For each sub-sample, the forecast horizons are 10
days, 20 days and 30 days.
Root mean square prediction errors (RMSPE) of each nonlinear ARðmÞ model
are compared with RMSPE of the corresponding benchmark model. The benchmark
model is simply the linear ARðmÞ model. We compute the ratio of RMSPE of the
nonlinear ARðmÞ to the RMSPE of the linear ARðmÞ to measure the out-of-sample
performance between the nonlinear and linear models. A ratio of less than one indicates the nonlinear model outperforms the linear model, providing more accurate
predictions in the out-of-sample forecast. Similarly, a ratio greater than one indicates
the nonlinear model provides less accurate predictions than the benchmark linear
model.
Table 5 reports the ratios for the 19 sub-samples. Panel A shows the ratios of the
PC-m Cases and NC-m Cases for the 10-day forecast horizon. 10 Panels B and C
show the ratios for the 20- and 30-day forecast horizons, respectively. Panel A reports Model 1’s ratio is the smallest of the ﬁve models for both cases. The average
ratio for the PC-m Cases is 0.696 and for the NC-m Cases is 0.729. This indicates that
the asymmetric, nonlinear AR(1) model yields an average forecast improvement of
30.4% for the PC-m Case and 27.1% for the NC-m Case, respectively. The asymmetric, nonlinear AR(1) model also outperforms the linear AR(1) model for 20- and 30day forecast horizons. The forecast improvements of the asymmetric, nonlinear
9

The sum of all the sub-sample observations is 18,612, which is the total number of observations for the
entire period of 01/03/29–12/31/98.

We found similar results for the cases with the prior holding-period return patterns.

AR(1) model are conﬁrmed by the number of periods with ratios less than one. Panel
A shows that 18 of the 19 sub-samples show a forecast improvement for the PC-m
Cases and 17 of the 19 for the NC-m Cases. The results for the 20- and 30-day forecast horizons also show similar forecast improvements.

4. Trading strategies and proﬁtability
The asymmetric reverting patterns of return dynamics can be used to generate
proﬁtable trading rules. Cases PH-m and PC-m initiate long position signals, and
Cases NH-m and NC-m generate short position signals. These trading rules exploit
the observed asymmetry in the estimated unconditional mean returns.
Two trading rules for detecting buy and sell signals are controlled by a prior
m-day holding-period return pattern and a prior m-day consecutive return pattern.

Under the rule controlled by a prior holding-period return pattern, PH-m Cases generate buy signals, and NH-m Cases generate sell signals. Likewise, under the rule
controlled by a prior consecutive return pattern, PC-m Cases generate buy signals,
and NC-m Cases generate sell signals. For each rule, there are ﬁve trading strategies
that can be implemented along with a value of m. 11 Under the rule with the prior
holding-period return pattern, for example, the strategy of m ¼ 2 initiates a buy signal when the prior 2-day holding period return is positive and a sell signal when the
prior 2-day holding period return is negative. Under the rule with the prior consecutive return pattern, the strategy of m ¼ 2 initiates a buy (sell) signal when the prior
2-consecutive daily returns are positive (negative). It should be noted that the strategy with m ¼ 1 is identical under both rules.
In order to evaluate the proﬁtability of each trading strategy, we apply the analysis of Brock et al. (1992). Table 6 presents the standard test results for the trading
strategies of the two trading rules using daily return data on the S&P 500 index. Column 1 represents the diﬀerent strategies deﬁned by the value of m under each rule.
Columns 2 and 3 refer to the number of buy and sell signals for the diﬀerent strategies, and Columns 4 and 5 show the mean daily returns during buy and sell periods
with corresponding t-statistics (in parenthesis below) testing the diﬀerence of mean
buy and mean sell from the unconditional 1-day mean. Columns 6 and 7 show the
fraction of buy and sell returns greater than zero, and the last column shows the
buy–sell spread, which is the average daily buy return minus the average daily sell
return.
A strategy is successful when there is a signiﬁcant positive return for each signal
and a positive spread between the buy and sell signals. The results in Table 6 shows
that buy signals in general generate statistically signiﬁcant positive returns and sell
signals generate negative returns. For strategies under the rule controlled by a prior
holding period return pattern, the buy returns are all positive with an average daily
return of 0.0798% (20.75% annualized). This result compares with the unconditional
mean daily return of 0.0275% (7.15% annualized). The sell returns are negative with
an average daily return of )0.0356% ()9.26% annualized). The t-tests for the ﬁve
strategies reject the null hypothesis that the buy and sell returns are insigniﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the unconditional daily mean return at the 1% level using a two-tailed
test. The spread between buy and sell returns across all strategies is positive and statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level, with an average daily spread of 0.1154%. Also,
53.6% of buy signals generate positive returns and 50.5% of sell signals generate negative returns.
For the strategies under the rule controlled by prior consecutive daily return patterns, only strategies with m ¼ 1 and 2 have statistical signiﬁcance at the 5% level.
For the two strategies, the table shows positive buy signals, negative sell signals,
and positive buy–sell spreads. Partial success of strategies based upon the prior
consecutive return patterns might be directly associated with the ﬁnding that the

11
Each strategy with a value of m corresponds to Model m in each case. For example, the strategy of
m ¼ 3 under the Case PH-m exploits the asymmetry identiﬁed with Model 3 under the PH-m Case.

asymmetric reverting pattern is better identiﬁed with a positive or negative pattern of
a prior m-day holding-period return as a control variable than with the pattern of a
prior m-daily consecutive return.
Table 7 reports the same standard test results for the two sub-periods. Panels 1
and 2 present the test results for the ﬁrst and second sub-period samples, respectively. For the ﬁrst sub-period, strategies based upon the prior holding period return
pattern generate positive buy returns, negative sell returns, and positive buy–sell
spreads that are all statistical signiﬁcant. The results are consistent with those for
the full-period samples. The buy returns are all positive with an average daily return
of 0.0694% (18.04% annualized), and the sell returns are all negative with an average
daily return of )0.0402% ()10.45% annualized). However, the test for the strategies
based upon prior consecutive return patterns generates somewhat inconsistent results. While the buy signals generate a positive return for all strategies, the sell signals
generate mixed results.
Panel 2 presents the test results for the second sub-period sample. All the strategies based upon the prior holding-period return patterns generate positive buy returns, negative sell returns, and positive buy–sell spreads, with statistical
signiﬁcance at the 1% level. The panel also shows that buy signals consistently generate more positive returns (54.73%) than do sell signals (49.67%). However, not all
strategies under the rule controlled by the prior consecutive return pattern are successful. Only the strategies m ¼ 1 and 2 generate a statistically signiﬁcant positive return, and the strategies m ¼ 1–3 generate a statistically signiﬁcant negative return
and a positive buy–sell spread. In general, the results for the two sub-period samples
are consistent with those for the full-period sample; positive buy returns, negative
sell returns, and positive buy–sell spreads.
A number of studies have investigated the movement of stock prices after an extreme return shock. 12 For example, Brown et al. (1988) document that extreme price
changes, either positive or negative, are followed by signiﬁcant positive returns. Atkins and Dyl (1990) and Bremer and Sweeney (1991) ﬁnd that stocks that experience
extreme 1-day price declines earn signiﬁcant abnormal returns. 13 Hudson et al.
(2001) investigate the pattern of returns after extreme 1-day return changes of various sizes. They ﬁnd that returns exhibit persistence after a large 1-day price change.
Thus, it is meaningful to test whether the magnitude eﬀect of extreme 1-day price
changes is exploitable for the proﬁtability of technical trading strategies.
We check the proﬁtability on the implied strategies based upon the prior return
pattern with a one standard deviation return change. 14 Even with a long series of
data, consecutive extreme return shocks are quite infrequent, thus we only consider

12

The authors are indebted to an anonymous referee on this point.
While Cox and Peterson (1994) attribute the reversal to bid–ask bounce, Park (1995) notes that much
of the reversal can be attributed to market structure.
14
Estimation results of all ﬁve models based upon the one standard deviation return change also show
statistically signiﬁcant asymmetry in return dynamics.

the strategies under the rule controlled by a prior holding-period return pattern. 15
In this case, each strategy generates a buy (sell) signal when the prior m-day holding-period return is greater than (less than) one standard deviation.
Table 8 presents the standard test results for proﬁtability of the strategies based
upon a one standard deviation change. The table shows consistent test results across
all three samples. For the full-period sample, all ﬁve strategies generate proﬁtable
buy and sell signals, with strong statistical signiﬁcance. The buy returns are all positive with an average return of 0.1154% (30% annualized), and the sell returns are
all negative with an average daily return of )0.0484% ()12.58% annualized). The
average buy–sell spread is 0.1639% (42.6% annualized). These numbers are greater
than those in Table 6, 16 implying that strategies based upon a one standard deviation return change are more proﬁtable. Tests for the two sub-periods also show similar results; statistically signiﬁcant positive returns for buy signals, negative returns
for sell signals, and positive buy–sell spreads.
In sum, the standard tests indicate that the strategies exploiting asymmetric
reverting patterns are proﬁtable. Standard tests show that most strategies considered
generate positive returns for buy signals, negative returns for sell signals, and positive spreads. The source of the positive (negative) return for buy (sell) signals is the
positive (negative) unconditional mean of return dynamics, which is induced from
the asymmetrical evolution of the return process identiﬁed under the prior return
pattern. The asymmetry is better captured by the cases controlled by the prior holding-period return pattern. The strategies based upon the prior holding-period return
pattern yield more reliable and consistent standard test results than under the rule
controlled by the prior consecutive daily return pattern. 17
Based on empirical results we conclude that the observed asymmetry in return
dynamics is exploitable and proﬁtable.

5. Concluding remarks
This paper explores a possible link between an asymmetric dynamic process of
stock returns and proﬁtable technical trading rules. Using daily returns on the
S&P 500 market index, we have identiﬁed an asymmetry in return dynamics. This
15
For example, there are only 66 cases observed for the three consecutive realizations of an extreme
negative shock, with one standard deviation return change for the entire sample period.
16
Buy (sell) signals generate 20.75% ()9.26%) annualized, and the buy–sell spread generates 30% at an
annual rate of return.
17
It should be noted that, even though daily index returns exhibit a strong reverting pattern under
negative price changes, our results show that trading rules exploiting the reverting pattern, i.e., negative
feedback trading rules are not proﬁtable (yielding a negative return). This negative return of the negative
feedback trading rules is due to a negative unconditional mean return under a prior negative price change.
In other words, although a negative return tends to revert quickly, its reverting magnitude is not suﬃcient
enough to generate a positive unconditional mean return, such that it is not exploitable for the proﬁtability
of negative feedback trading rules. Obviously, persisting magnitude is greater than reverting magnitude of
a negative return, thereby yielding a negative unconditional mean return.

asymmetrical evolution of return generating processes induces a positive (negative)
unconditional mean return under a prior positive (negative) return pattern for daily
index returns.
We have shown that the asymmetry in return dynamics can be exploited by generating proﬁtable buy and sell signals for various technical trading strategies. When a
buy signal occurs, a long position is taken in the index for one day. Similarly, when a
sell signal occurs, a short position is taken in the index for one day. Our results show
that the asymmetry is the main source of proﬁtability for the implied strategies; the
positive (negative) unconditional mean is consistent with a subsequent positive (negative) return.
Our results also indicate that trading strategies for buy and sell signals based upon
prior m-day holding-period return patterns yield greater predictive power and profitability than those based upon prior m-daily consecutive return patterns. 18 In conclusion, viewed from the fact that the observed asymmetry of return dynamics is the
main source of proﬁtability for the implied trading strategies, it is diﬃcult to negate
the usefulness of technical trading strategies in stock market investments.

We have performed the same standard test for each strategy by changing the holding period up to ﬁve
days before closing the transaction position. The tests show a consistent result that a one day holding
period leads to the best outcome for all strategies. We also have performed the same test on weekly return
series and 10-day return series. Surprisingly, most of the strategies do not yield signiﬁcant proﬁtability
before transaction costs. In addition, we have extended our analysis by changing m to 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50
days for identifying a prior holding-period return. The results are very similar to those found in Table 6, a
positive return for buy signals, a negative return for sell signals, and a positive spread, with strong
statistical signiﬁcance.
