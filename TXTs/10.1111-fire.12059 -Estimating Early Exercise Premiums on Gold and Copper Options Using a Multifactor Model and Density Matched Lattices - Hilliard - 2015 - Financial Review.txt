Abstract
We use the standard geometric Brownian motion augmented by jumps to describe the
spot underlying and mean regressive models of interest rates and convenience yields as
state variables for gold and copper prices. Estimates of parameters of the diffusion processes
are obtained by the Kalman filter. Using these estimates, jump parameters are estimated in
the second stage by least squares. Early exercise premia on puts and calls are computed using
a lattice with probabilities assigned by the density matching technique. We find that while
deep in the money options have greater absolute early exercise premiums, the early exercise
premium is roughly constant as a percent of option price. Our findings also confirm that gold
behaves like an investment asset and copper behaves like a commodity.

1. Introduction
Pricing futures contracts on commodities is investigated by a number of scholars
including work and references in Schwartz (1997). In this extension, we estimate the
early exercise premium on American options on gold and copper futures contracts.
Ramaswamy and Sundaresan (1985) and others establish that options on futures contracts have positive early exercise premiums. Essentially, the instantaneous interest
rate on a futures contract behaves like a continuous dividend.
Typical commodity pricing models progress in complexity and explanatory
power from a one-factor model based on the underlying to a two-factor model that adds
stochastic interest rates and to a three-factor model that adds both stochastic interest
rates and convenience yield. We use standard geometric Brownian motion (gBm)
augmented by jumps to describe the spot underlying and mean regressive models of
interest rates and convenience yields as state variables for gold and copper prices.1 An
important question with respect to pricing models is whether these metals behave like
an investment asset or a commodity. Previous work indicates that gold behaves like
an investment asset while copper behaves like a commodity. See Schwartz (1997),
Hull (2006), or Hilliard and Reis (HR, 1998) for a further review of the properties of
investment and commodity assets.
We compute early exercise premia on puts and calls using a three-dimensional
lattice with probabilities assigned by the density matching technique. The density
matching technique, developed in Hilliard (2014) and Hilliard and Hilliard (2014)
extends to multivariate applications and shows excellent convergence properties.
We contribute to the literature with our empirical findings and our methodology.
We compute the early exercise premium using a density matched lattice that prices
both European options and American options. We find, somewhat surprisingly, that
within a maturity class, the early exercise premium for these metals as a percent of
option price is relatively constant. We confirm the finding that the absolute early
exercise premium on gold and copper contracts increases with moneyness. With our
data set, we also confirm the earlier findings from Schwartz (1997) that gold behaves
like an investment asset and copper behaves like a commodity with convenience yield.
We extend the methodology by estimating parameters of a three-factor model with
jumps using a two-stage procedure. Schwartz (1997) uses observed futures prices
and the Kalman filter to estimate parameters for an identical three-factor diffusion.
We add jumps to the underlying giving a three-factor model with jumps. Jumps,

1 Models that use jump diffusions to model European option prices include those of Ball and Torous
(1983), Naik and Lee (1990), Bates (1996), Scott (1997), and Duffie, Pan and Singleton (2000). The
usual assumption is that the jump magnitude is normal. The double exponential jump model studied by
Kou (2004) and Ramezani and Zeng (2007) also has theoretical and empirical support. Huang and Wu
(2004) consider time-changed Lévy processes and find that a high-frequency jump structure outperforms
the low-frequency compound Poisson jump specification.

however, do not generally effect futures prices.2 In the first stage, we therefore use
futures prices and the Kalman filter to estimate diffusion (nonjump) parameters. In
the second stage, we fix first stage estimates and use option prices and a three-factor
option pricing model to estimate implied jump parameters. In our simulations, this
procedure proves to be accurate and robust.

2. The setup
We make the assumption that physical commodity prices, St , follow a jumpdiffusion system written as
dS
= (μs − c − λJ̄ )dt + σs dZs + Jdq,
S
dc = κc (μc − c)dt + σc dZ c ,

(1)

dr = κr (μr − r)dt + σr dZ r ,
while convenience yield (c) and interest rates (r) follow a mean-reverting
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) diffusion. The innovations dZ s , dZ c , and dZ r are multivariate normal. See Schwartz (1997), Vasicek (1977) and others for a justification of the mean-reverting OU model for convenience yield and interest
rates. The jump-diffusion process is used extensively for equities, commodities
and currencies. The literature is extensive and includes the seminal works of
Merton (1976) and Bates (1991). The jump component is represented by Jdq where
2

ln(1 + J ) ∼ N (γ − δ2 , δ 2 ) ≡ N(γ , δ 2 ) and dq = 1 if a jump occurs. The probability
that a jump occurs in an infinitesimal interval dt is λdt. The average jump size is J̄ ≡
E[J ] = eγ − 1. The adjustment coefficients in the mean regressive interest rate and
convenience yield diffusions are κr and κc and the long-term means are μc and μr .
The risk-neutralized futures diffusion is derived in HR and is given by
dF̂
= −λk̄dt + σ (τ )dZ F + Jdq,
(2)
F

σ (τ ) = σs2 + σc2 Hc2 + σr2 Hr2 − 2σs σc ρsc Hc + 2σs σr ρsr Hr − 2σc σr Hc Hr ρcr ,
−κτ

is a factor that attenuates time
where τ is the time to maturity and H = 1−eκ
to maturity. For small τ, H ≈ τ − κτ 2 ≤ τ. The innovation in the diffusion term
depends on other state variables and is given by σ (τ )dZ F = σs dZ s − Hc (τ )σc dZ c +
Hr (τ )σr dZ r .
2 See Casassus and Collin-DuFresne (2005) for a discussion of special factor models in which there can
be a small effect.

3. The futures pricing lattice
We develop a pricing lattice in order to evaluate gold and copper options. As in
Hilliard and Schwartz (2005), we transform to log form and consider the diffusion
and jump components as two separate and independent factors. In log form, we write
the jump diffusion as y = log(F̂ ) and thus


σ 2 (τ )
dt + σ (τ )dZ F + ln(1 + J )dq
(3)
dy = −λk̄ −
2
≡ du∗ + dv,
and now du∗ is normalized so that
⎞
⎛
2
−λk̄ − σ 2(τ )
⎠ dt + dZF
du = ⎝
σ (τ )

(4)

≡ mdt + dZF .
A two-dimensional lattice for the underlying is implemented using du and dv =
ln(1 + J ) in the second dimension. A third dimension is required since nodes must
be discounted by stochastic interest rates. Normalizing volatility to one for interest
rates, the lattice is
√
(5)
	u = ± 	,
	v = j δ, j = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3,
√
	r = ± 	,
where 	 = τn is the time step, n is the number of steps in the lattice, and 	r
is normalized by σr to give unit volatility. The lattice allows the diffusion to be
approximated by binomial jumps while the Poisson directed process is approximated
by jumps to one of seven possible nodes.3 There is some efficiency in the above
characterization since it is not necessary to develop the lattice in the convenience
yield dimension. Convenience yield comes into play only in its effect on futures
volatility, σ (τ ) .
We compute the probabilities at each node using a density matching technique.
The node at each time step branches to one of ≡ (2)(2)(7) = 28 nodes in the following
T
step. Each node is uniquely identified by a row vector
√ of the form Ak = (a1 , a2 , b),
where T denotes transpose, the elements ai = ± 	, i = 1, 2 correspond to the
diffusion process, and the elements b = j δ, j = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3 correspond to jump
3 The choice of jumps of seven nodes is arbitrary. This choice has some experimental support (Hilliard
and Hilliard, 2014).

innovations. In the density matching technique, the conditional probability of a jump
to one of K nodes is
p (Ak )
p (Ak |k = 1, 2, . . . , K) = K
,
(6)
k=1 p(Ak )
where the continuous-time diffusion process corresponding to the vector Ak has
a multivariate normal density. Since the jumps are independent of the diffusion
innovations, the probability assigned to node Ak can be written
P (Ak ) = p (a1 , a2 ) pJ (b) .

D is the

The probability assigned to the Poisson directed component is given by the
mixture of normals (see Das, 2002)
pJ (b) = pJ (b|dq = 1)	λ + pJ (b|dq = 0) (1 − 	λ) ,

For American options, inverse transforms are used at all nodes to recover F and
r. The one-period recursion for option price O (the typical notation is O ≡ C for
calls and O ≡ P for puts) is
O(Ft , τ ) = max {OE (Ft , τ ), OC (Ft , t)} ,

(11)

where OE is the exercise value of the derivative and OC is the continuation value,
computed as

P (Ak )O(Ft+1,k )
OC (Ft , t) = k

where Ft+1,k , k = 1, 2, . . . , 28 is the set of all states accessible at time t + 1 from
state Ft . For European prices, let OC = O and use Equation (12). For more detail
on the density matching setup for lattice probabilities, see Hilliard (2014) or Hilliard
and Hilliard (2014).

4. Parameter estimation
In our empirical application, we use the density matching technique to estimate
the early exercise premium on copper and gold options. We use state variables similar
to those of Schwartz (1997) and HR. Specifically, the underlying spot is assumed to
be a standard jump-diffusion process while both convenience yield and interest rates
are assumed to follow an OU process. HR note that futures prices are not affected
by jumps since the payoff function is linear and the expected contribution of jumps
null out in the compensated jump diffusion. Casassus and Collin-DuFresne (2005),
using the same state variables in a more generalized setup, show that jumps can affect
futures prices when convenience yield is a function of the underlying. They conclude
that the impact of jumps is likely to be minimal when jump intensity and jump size
is small.
In our model, jumps do not affect futures prices. This allows us to pursue a twostage process for estimating parameters. First, we use bond and futures prices, and
the Kalman filter to estimate all nonjump parameters. Then, we fix these parameters
and imply jump parameters by minimizing the sum of squared errors between option
observations and model predictions.
The standard setup for the Kalman filter consists of a measurement equation and
a transition equation. Using the standard notation we write
yt = Z t x t + d t + ε t ,

(13)

where yt is a vector of observations (the data) and xt is a vector of state variables that
are typically latent. Exogenous parameters are included in dt while ε t is a vector of
zero mean errors. The transition equation is written
x t = T x t−1 + α t + Rηt ,
(14)
where we use the symbol α t for parameters instead of the usual ct to avoid confusion
with our notation for convenience yield. The error term in the transition equation has
covariance RRT where  ≡ cov[η, nT ]. When all random variables are Gaussian
the Kalman filter gives the optimal estimator of xt and it can also be structured to
obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates. As Harvey (1989) points out, the
Kalman filter provides the minimum mean squared error among all linear estimators even when the normality assumption is violated. Applications in the financial
econometrics literature are found in sources including Schwartz (1997), Babbs and
Nowman (1999), Chen and Scott (2003), Schwartz and Smith (2000), and Trolle and
Schwartz (2009).
We require bond data and commodity data to estimate all nonjump parameters.
The Kalman setup for estimating interest rate parameters using bond data is in the
Appendix. Here, we focus on the Kalman filter for estimating commodity parameters.
For the physical system given in Equation (1), the futures pricing equation may be
written
ln(F (t, Ti )B(t, Ti )) = ln(St ) − Hc Ct + ln (A(τ )D1 D2 D3 )i + εit , i = 1, 2, . . . N ,
(15)

33

J. E. Hilliard and J. Hilliard/The Financial Review 50 (2015) 27–56

where F (t, Ti ) is the observed futures price with maturity Ti and Bi is the default free
bond price with the same maturity. Functional forms and definitions of A and D are in
the Appendix. The state variables are log spot prices, ln(St ), and convenience yield,
Ct . The error term is added to account for errors in measurement. We assume that the
error term is normal, homoskedastic, and cross sectionally uncorrelated. For a set of
futures contracts trading at time-t, say N = 3, the Kalman setup for the measurement
equation is

We allow for correlations between ηst and ηct . For economy of presentation, this
setup depicts three observations (N = 3) at each time point. We actually use N = 5
when estimating interest rate parameters and N = 9 when estimating commodity
parameters. Schwartz and Smith (2000) emphasize that if we increase the vector of
futures contracts of varying maturity there will typically be little uncertainty about
the state variables.
Pricing relations in the measurement equation are derived using risk-neutral
measures. Therefore, the risk-neutralized drift in rates and yield are adjusted so that
the constant λσ is subtracted from the drift of both OU diffusions. The assumption
of a constant risk adjustment is an oversimplification but it is commonly used in the
literature in order to capture first-order effects. The latent variables in the transition
equation are not risk-adjusted since the transition equation should capture the physical
evolution of the latent variables. In the typical case, risk neutralizing the latent
variables in the transition equation would result in a downward bias to their physical
values.

4.1. Parameters estimated from simulated data
We first test the accuracy of our Kalman setup by estimating parameters for
simulated data. Interest rates and convenience yields are generated daily by the OU
process and five maturity bond prices are computed using the Vasicek (1977) model.
The underlying spot is also simulated using the full jump-diffusion specification.4
There are 200 iterations. At the beginning of each iteration, maturities are of length
60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 days. They are reduced by one day for 30 consecutive
days and then a new iteration begins. The results are given in Table 1. The parameter
value is designated by θ, the starting point by θ0 , the estimate by θ̂ and the standard
error of the estimate by σθ̂ . All estimates and standard errors are obtained using a
Kalman filter and the Gauss program MaxLik with the BFGS maximization option.
The   s refer to measurement errors and the other parameters are defined in the
standard way for the OU process. Maximum likelihood estimates of the adjustment
parameter is biased, but consistent (see, e.g., Tang and Chen, 2009). However, the
estimates for the process (n = 6,000) that we simulate are quite accurate. For example,
for interest rates, the speed of adjustment coefficient is κ̂r = 0.5193 (parameter
= 0.5000) and the volatility is 
σr = 0.0195 (parameter = 0.0200). For convenience
yields, the speed of adjustment coefficient is κ̂c = 1.0459 (parameter = 1.0459).
Convenience and diffusion volatilities are 
σc = 0.2469 (parameter = 0.2490) and

σs = 0.2687 (parameter = 0.2660), respectively. Correlation between convenience
and spot innovations is estimated to be ρ̂ = 0.7976 (parameter = 0.8050). Standard
errors for the speed of adjustment coefficient are 0.0331 for interest rates and 0.0101
for convenience yields.

4.2. Data
We use daily data to estimate the parameters for interest rates, convenience
yields and the diffusion component of the underlying futures. The data are obtained
from CME Datamine. The daily data extend from June 23, 2003 until March 2, 2009.
The time span for the out-of-sample data is from June 23, 2002 until December
16, 2008. The time span for the in-sample data is from December 17, 2008 until
March 2, 2012. A summary of the data for copper futures is given in Table 2. There
are 19,839 out-of-sample observations and 615 in-sample observations. F1 refers
to futures contracts with up to 60 days until maturity, F2 to futures contracts with
maturities between 61 and 120 days, F3 to futures contracts with up to 180 days, and
so on. A summary of the data for gold futures is given in Table 3. There are 15,070
out-of-sample observations and 553 in-sample observations. Though not shown here,
longer maturities were available for gold relative to copper, perhaps reflecting the fact
that gold is used more as an investment asset or a long-term hedge against inflation.

Interest rates are computed for the Vasicek (1977) process with five maturity bond contracts generated for each day. In this simulation, the market price of risk
is zero. At the beginning of each iteration contracts are of length 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 days. They are reduced by one day for 30 consecutive days and
then a new iteration begins. There are 200 iterations. The parameter value is designated by θ, the starting point by θ0 , the estimate by θ̂ and the standard error of
the estimate by σθ̂ . All estimates and standard errors are obtained using the Kalman filter, the Gauss program MaxLik, and the BFGS maximization option. LL
is the value of the log-likelihood function. The ’s refer to measurement errors and the other parameters are defined in the standard way for a mean regressive
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.

A summary of the data for copper and gold futures options is given in Tables 4
and 5, respectively. These data begin in December 17, 2008 and are out-of-sample
with respect to the estimation of nonjump parameters. Jump parameters are estimated
in this period but they are also-of-sample since they are lagged by one day before
being used in the pricing model.

Table 3
Statistics for gold futures
F1 are futures contracts with maturities up to 60 days, F2 are futures contracts with maturities between 61
and 120 days, F3 are contracts with 121–180 days, and so on. Contracts with maturities over 780 days are
not shown in the table since these maturities are sparsely populated.

4.3. Estimation results—non-jump parameters
Estimation results for gold and copper parameters are in Table 6. In the first
stage, diffusion parameters are estimated using futures and bond contracts at nine
maturities. For copper, convenience yields are assumed to follow an OU process
and are defined in the standard way. We initially assumed that gold follows an OU
process but we find that to be an incorrect specification (parameter estimates failed),
presumably because gold is primarily an investment asset. Therefore, we assume

Parameter estimates for gold and copper

Parameters are estimated using nine maturity futures and bond contracts for each trading day from June
23, 2003 until December 16, 2008. The parameter estimates are denoted by θ̂ and the standard error of
the estimate is denoted by σθ̂ . LL is the value of the log-likelihood function. All estimates and standard
errors are obtained using a Kalman filter and the Gauss program MaxLik with the BFGS maximization
option. For copper, both short-term rates and convenience yield are assumed to follow an Ornstein–
Uhlenbeck process and are defined in the standard way. For gold, short-term rates are assumed to follow
geometric Brownian motion with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck interest rates. Parameter estimates with subscript
c refers to convenience yields and subscript r refers to short-term interest rates. The first four parameters
corresponding to the interest rate process are estimated independently and then input into the second
program that estimates smooth stock parameters and convenience yield parameters. The standard errors in
the measurement (transition) residuals are denoted by σε (ση ).

that the gold return process has no convenience yield and is more correctly specified
as a standard jump diffusion. Stochastic interest rates are assumed to follow an
OU process. The first four parameters corresponding to the interest rate process are
estimated independently and then input into the second program that estimates stock
diffusion parameters and convenience yield parameters. Schwartz (1997) documents
that the impact of stochastic rates on commodities, especially in the short-term
contracts, is negligible. While less than ideal, this procedure simplifies estimation
while assuming only that interest rates have little impact on gold and copper parameter
estimates.

The copper, gold, and interest rate parameters are in Panels A, B, and C of
Table 6, respectively. Interest rate parameters differ slightly since copper and gold
data screens result in slightly different data sets. The beginning and ending dates
are the same but on some days, either the gold or copper data set would not have
sufficient observations and that day would be deleted from the respective sample.
The estimates are similar for copper (gold) with estimates κ̂r = 0.3406 (0.3306),
σ̂r = 0.0113 (0.0124),and μ̂r = 0.0374 (0.0364). Risk adjustment estimates for copper (gold) were small, λ̂σ̂r = −0.0028 (−0.0030) and not significant.
Copper estimates in Panel A show a diffusion volatility of σ̂s = 0.4484, convenience yield volatility of σ̂c = 0.1184 and a positive correlation between the diffusion innovation and convenience yield of ρ̂sc = 0.5908. Neither μs or μc are
required for futures option pricing under the risk-neutral measure. Vasicek(1977)
bond prices depend on the risk-adjusted long-term mean that is estimated by
= 0.04562 for the copper data set and 0.04547
μ̂∗r = μ̂r − λ̂κ̂r σ̂r r = 0.0374 + 0.0028
0.3406
for the gold data set.
Gold estimates under the gBm assumption are in Panel B. The volatility is
estimated to be σ̂s = 0.2670 and the correlation estimate with interest rates is ρ̂sr =
−0.2519. The measurement and transition errors are assumed to be homoskedastic
for both gold and silver contracts. The standard errors are small and of order 10−3 .
Our estimates are consistent with respect to sign and approximate magnitude
with those of Schwartz (1997), who uses weekly data sets with domains July 9, 1990
to June 13, 1995 for copper and November 21, 1990 to June 13, 1995 for gold.
The Schwartz three-factor model is the same as our model net of jumps. Parameter
estimates are similar and like Schwartz we find that there is no mean reversion in
gold prices.

4.3.1. Implied jump parameters
Twelve futures contracts are chosen each day with maturities between the 30 and
780 days. For each futures contract, data on nine option contracts are recorded, with
levels of moneyness centered on the at-the-money contract. Thus, when there was no
exact at-the-money option contract, we record either five out-of-the money and four
in-the-money contracts or four out-of-the money and five in-the-money contracts.
We estimate implied jump parameters by first converting American option prices
to European prices using the procedure in Broadie, Chernov and Johannes (2007)
and Trolle and Schwartz (2009). In this procedure, an American pricing model under
the gBm assumption is used to find the implied volatility for the underlying.5 Then,
the implied volatility is used in the European Black model to construct an artificial

5 To find the American implied volatility, Trolle and Schwartz (2009) used the Barone-Adesi and Whaley
(1987) approximation while we use approximations from a 200-step binomial tree. Broadie, Chernov and
Johannes (2007) also use a binomial tree.

European option price. While admittedly ad hoc, Trolle and Schwartz (2009) note in
simulation studies that pricing errors (simulated European prices) are approximately
zero at short maturities and very small for longer maturities. Broadie, Chernov and
Johannes (2007) use a different model with jumps (stochastic volatility with jumps).
In their simulations, they find acceptable but slightly larger errors in European prices.
Implied jump parameters are estimated each day for the period December 17,
2008 until March 2, 2009.6 Diffusion parameters are fixed at values estimated during
the prior period extending from June 23, 2003 until December 16, 2008. One exception to this rule is used for copper options. A much better fit is obtained for copper
when the diffusion volatility, σs , is used as the starting point and reestimated in the
subsequent period. Thus, for copper, the four implied parameters estimated are: jump

the Trolle and Schwartz (2009) procedure. The model price Vm is computed by the
HR model given in the Appendix. The model is compounded over Poisson events
with an infinite number of terms. However, we find that prices are unchanged after
30 terms when output is formatted to nine significant places. We center the number
of terms around the mean number of expected events, λ(T − t), where T − t is the
time to expiration of the option.
There are up to 108 observations per day, consisting of 12 futures contracts
and options with up to nine strikes. Days without observations are omitted and the
previous day’s estimates are used when there were fewer than eight observations. We
also screened high in-the-money options that, in the limit, contain no second moment
information. An option is included as an observation only if the exercise value is less
than 25% of the option price. In general, implied parameters are robust to the starting
point.
Typical values are in Table 7. The diffusion volatility for calls is higher than that
for puts for both copper and gold (0.1725–0.1641 for copper and 0.3009–0.1119 for
gold). Other studies consistently show that the “volatility spread” (implied volatility
of calls minus that of puts) is negative. For example, Cremers and Weinbaum (2010)
study volatility spreads for all stocks in the OptionMetrics database from 1996 to 2005
and find that average put implied volatility exceeds average call implied volatility
6 American and European option prices are computed numerically using a trivariate tree. While the out-ofsample data extended until January 31, 2012, we only estimated parameters for the first 50 days because
of the computational load involved in pricing options multiple options per day on a trivariate tree.

5. Early exercise estimates
American contracts on copper and gold future options have nonzero early exercise premiums. Lacking simultaneous trading of otherwise identical American and
European options, we evaluate early exercise premiums using the three-factor model
with jumps in the underlying. The lattice is evaluated both with and without the possibility of early exercise. The early exercise premium is then the difference between
the American option and the equivalent European option. During the out-of-sample
period, implied jump parameters are estimated daily (using Equation (19)) and used
in pricing calculations the next day. In general, we observe very small early exercise premiums because the out-of-sample period is in a low interest rate regime and
because the options mature in less than one year. Short maturity contracts are chosen because they are most liquid and because evaluating a three-dimensional tree is

time-consuming.8 For a short maturity contract, the numerical model with 20 steps
performs quite well as can be seen from the data in the following tables. We note no
significant improvements by increasing the number of steps.

5.1. Copper
Early exercise statistics for calls are in Table 8. Copper call prices over all data
average about $0.22. The average early exercise premium over all maturities and
strikes are in Panel A. The absolute early exercise premium is nonzero in the fourth
place and averages about $0.0003. The average early percent exercise premium is
about 15 basis points. While very small, the early exercise premium increases with
moneyness. Notably the percentage early exercise premium is virtually unchanged
over moneyness because the increasing premium with moneyness is largely offset by
increases in option price.
Moneyness affects early exercise premiums. Panels B, C, and D give results
for the second, third and fourth nearby contract. The most in-the-money contacts
have early exercise prices roughly two to three times greater than the most out-ofthe money contracts. Early exercise premiums, as a percent, averages about 5 basis
points for the second nearby contract, 12 basis points for the third nearby contract, and
19 basis points for the fourth nearby contract.
Copper put statistics are in Table 9. Copper put prices over all data average about
$0.21. Moneyness and maturity ranges are the same as in Table 8. Early exercise
premiums, though still modest, are much higher for puts than for calls. Overall, the
percent early exercise for puts averages about 39 basis points (Panel A) or more than
twice that of calls (15 basis points). Still, the absolute level of the early exercise
premium is quite small. The largest absolute early exercise premium, Panel D, is
$0.0022 (over 68 basis points) for options that are more than 10% in-the-money. We
observe that within a maturity class the average early exercise premium expressed as
a percent is relatively unchanged over moneyness. Please see Figure 1 for a graphic
depiction of moneyness versus percent early exercise premiums for both copper and
gold.

5.2. Gold
Gold call statistics are in Table 10. Gold call prices over all data average about
$76. Overall, early exercise premiums average about $0.18. While larger in absolute
value, the percentage early exercise premiums are very similar to those for copper,
averaging about 21 basis points. Both absolute and percent early exercise premiums
8 It takes about 16 seconds to evaluate one option on a 20-step tree. Increasing the number to steps to 50
increases the execution time for a single option to 9.6 minutes. The program is written in Gauss and the
computer is an HP Compaq 8200 Elite CMT with a 256 GB primary Solid State hard drive, a 3.40 GHz
processor, and 16 GB of RAM.

increase with maturity. Within a maturity class, percent early exercise premiums are
relatively constant. The largest absolute early exercise premium is $0.4282, for the
fourth nearby contract (longest maturity evaluated) that is most in-the-money (Panel
D). The largest percentage early exercise premium is about 41 basis points for calls
in the moneyness category 1.00–1.02.
Gold put statistics are in Table 11. Gold put prices over all data average about
$78. Early exercise premiums in Panel A average about $0.29, higher than the average
for calls at approximately $0.18. The percent early exercise premium is about 34 basis
points, compared to 21 basis points for calls. In Panel D, we observe the highest early

exercise premiums of about $0.68 and 63 basis points. The only notable difference
in gold puts is that the early exercise percent changes within moneyness levels from
about 9 basis points for moneyness <0.975 to about 25 basis points for moneyness
>1.025.

6. Summary and conclusions
We develop a lattice model for pricing options with multiple factors following
one or more jump diffusions. Jumps are modeled as a factor separate from that of the
diffusion. Lattice probabilities are derived using a multivariate probability density
function for diffusion components and a mixture of normals for the jump components.

The primary advantage of this approach is its general applicability to a variety of
multidimensional pricing applications and the property that node probabilities are
always well defined.
The Kalman filter with observed bond and futures prices is used to obtain
estimates of diffusion parameters for copper and gold. These estimates are held fixed
and implied jump parameters are updated daily to obtain early exercise estimates
using the lattice model. Because of the low interest rate environment and short dated
options, we find very modest early exercise premiums. We find that percentage
early exercise premiums within a maturity class do not exhibit much variation over
moneyness levels. The percent average early exercise premium is about 15 basis
points for calls and 35 basis points for puts.

A.2. Kalman filter—General setup
Consider the measurement equation
yt = Zt x t + d t + ε t

(A20)

x t = Tx t−1 + α t + Rηt .

(A21)

and the transition equation

There are N observations per period, m state variables, and t = 1, . . . , T time
series observations. The matrix Zt is N × m, dt is N × 1, and α t is m × 1. The
transition matrix T is m × m, R is m × g, and η is g × 1, where g is the number of error
sources. Given an initial estimate of the latent variables, x̂0 and the covariance matrix
of estimation errors (error = x̂t − xt ), P0 , the new covariance matrix of estimation
errors is
Pt|t−1 = T t Pt−1 T Tt + Rt Qt RTt ,

(A22)

where Qt = cov[ηt , ηTt ] and the notation t|t − 1 denotes an estimate at t, given the
information at t − 1. The updating equations are
t = Zt Pt|t−1 ZTt + Ht ,

(A23)

V t = yTt −Zx̂t|t−1 − dt ,

where V t is the error in estimating y and t is the covariance matrix of the estimation
errors.
