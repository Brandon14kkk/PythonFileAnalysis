I use experimental asset markets to analyze trading under different
transparency and information settings. I ﬁnd that both liquidity
and informed traders use undisclosed orders to compete for
liquidity provision. In opaque markets, traders increase aggressiveness to improve execution probability. Without information
friction, market opacity enhances liquidity, especially toward the
end of trading, and is beneﬁcial for liquidity traders. Under
informed trading, adverse selection drives market outcomes
mainly around news announcements. Monopolistic insiders
exploit opacity at the expense of large liquidity traders. Opacity
does not affect informational efﬁciency with a monopolistic insider, but value discovery is faster when informational rents are
shared.

1. Introduction
In most modern trading platforms, orders posted to the limit order book (LOB) also include
instructions specifying the degree of disclosure (Cheuvreux, 2012). Such orders, labeled as undisclosed (reserve or iceberg) orders, allow traders to limit the quantity exposure by concealing a
portion of the order. This feature reduces the pre-trade transparency of the market, since traders do
not observe the total depth available on the electronic LOB. Using laboratory markets, in this paper I
address two related yet unresolved questions regarding the use of undisclosed orders. The ﬁrst
question inquires about the source of hidden liquidity and its impact on the trading strategies of
market participants while the second is related to its implications on different dimensions of market
quality.
Undisclosed orders account for a large proportion of trading activity in major exchanges, for
example, more than 44% of the Euronext volume (Bessembinder, Panayides, and Venkataraman,
2009), about 28% of the Australian Stock Exchange volume (Aitken, Berkman, and Mak, 2001), 16% of
executed shares on Xetra (Frey and Sandas, 2008), and 20% of executions in the NASDAQ (Yao, 2013).1
However, the source of hidden liquidity is still controversial. Two separate viewpoints emerge
regarding the types of traders and their motivation for submitting undisclosed orders. According to
the ﬁrst view, large liquidity traders enter markets for exogenous reasons and prefer undisclosed
orders to compete with other liquidity suppliers and/or to protect their orders from fast traders (Buti
and Rindi, 2009, 2013). If only large liquidity traders (Harris, 1997) opt for undisclosed orders, then
the implications on market quality are mixed. While opacity improves depth at the top of the book, it
widens the spread at the expense of small traders. On the other hand, in the second view, informed
traders employ hidden liquidity to conceal private information and to minimize the price impact of
large orders. If this is the underlying reason, then opacity introduced through undisclosed orders
could harm the informational efﬁciency of ﬁnancial markets. While the effect on market quality is
positive due to increased trading volume (Moinas, 2010), this view also highlights the potential role of
undisclosed orders as a tool to obscure insider trading. Boulatov and George (2013) suggest that
hidden liquidity attracts informed traders to liquidity provision, hence improving liquidity and
informational efﬁciency via intense competition. Overall, even though the stock exchanges are in a
race to offer darker platforms, there is still no consensus in the academic literature on the virtues of
concealing orders.
I design an asset market experiment to study market opacity introduced via undisclosed orders
and its sensitivity to market friction induced by private information. I start with a baseline setting
under symmetric information where I rule out the potential effects of adverse selection on hidden
liquidity. I compare an opaque regime with a transparent alternative that excludes the possibility of
undisclosed orders. In a second setting, I introduce a monopolistic insider in experimental asset
markets, maintaining all other features. I also run additional sessions with two insiders. This design
allows competition among informed traders (Boulatov and George, 2013). I analyze trading
mechanisms under both symmetric and asymmetric information. My results contribute to the recent
debate on dark trading and have important implications for market design.
I document several interesting ﬁndings from the experimental asset markets. My ﬁrst observation
is that both liquidity and informed traders compete for liquidity provision (Boulatov and George,
2013; Collin-Dufresne and Fos, 2015) and make use of undisclosed orders. In opaque markets, on
average, about 20% of limit orders are replaced by undisclosed orders. Whenever traders reduce
liquidity consumption to control for price risk, they provide liquidity more aggressively to increase
execution probability, which in turn affects market liquidity. Both large liquidity and informed traders
submit, on average, more undisclosed orders compared to other trader types, but there is substantial
heterogeneity among informed traders: They either submit no undisclosed orders at all (nearly half of
informed traders) or supply hidden liquidity in large quantities and at price levels further away from
1
Some exchanges, such as the NASDAQ, the NYSE, and alternative trading platforms, that is, dark pools, also offer completely hidden orders. However, my analysis is limited to partially disclosed orders following theoretical models on undisclosed
orders (Moinas, 2010; Buti and Rindi, 2013).

the midquote. Nonetheless, informed traders manage to pool with large liquidity traders in liquidity
provision, exploit their informational advantage, and thus affect market outcomes.
Second, I show that large liquidity traders obtain higher trading proﬁts in opaque markets under
symmetric information, since liquidity consumption is cheaper. Once a monopolistic insider is
introduced to the market, however, large liquidity traders are negatively affected by reduced transparency, because monopolistic insiders are better at extracting informational rents. In other words,
under an opaque regime, a monopolistic insider is better off at the expense of large liquidity traders.
However, once informational rents are shared by two insiders, then market transparency has a minor
effect on the proﬁts of liquidity traders. These results suggest that any welfare analysis of market
transparency should control for the degree of adverse selection in the market.
Third, without an insider, reducing transparency contributes positively to market liquidity, especially toward the end of the trading period. Liquidity traders substitute part of the limit and marketable orders with undisclosed orders to reduce exposure to opportunistic traders and price risk but,
at the same time, they increase limit order aggressiveness to compensate for the reduction in
execution probability. This strategic behavior reduces both quoted bid–ask and realized spreads, that
is, the temporary price impact of marketable orders. Under asymmetric information, however, the
spread does not change overall under different transparency regimes. One exception is around public
news announcements: Thanks to market opacity, informed traders do not have to rush to exploit their
informational advantage and can afford to trade using less aggressive orders, that is, limit or undisclosed orders instead of marketable orders, but, to increase the execution probability, they submit
liquidity more aggressively, which reduces quoted spreads immediately after information release.
Increasing the degree of adverse selection with more insiders results in increased book depth in
opaque markets without affecting quoted spreads, in line with empirical evidence from the Toronto
Stock Exchange (Anand and Weaver, 2004). In the case of a monopolistic insider, transparency does
not affect the informational efﬁciency of asset markets, but value discovery is faster in opaque
markets when informational rents are shared between insiders (Boulatov and George, 2013).
Bloomﬁeld, O'Hara, and Saar (BOS, 2015) also ﬁnd that the depth dimension of liquidity improves due
to opacity, but the authors do not document any effect on informational efﬁciency. However, their
study has several differences in experimental design from mine, particularly regarding the quality of
the private information held by informed traders.
There are few theoretical papers on hidden liquidity. My market design is closely linked to a paper
by Buti and Rindi (2013), who study optimal order strategies in a dynamic LOB allowing undisclosed
orders. In their model, risk-neutral traders make simultaneous strategic decisions on price, quantity,
and exposure conditional on the state of the LOB and their private valuations of assets. Buti and
Rindi's model extends the models of both Foucault (1999) and Parlour (1998), who abstract from
private information. In equilibrium, large traders submit hidden liquidity to electronic LOB for two
different motivations: to avoid competition for liquidity provision and/or to avoid being picked off by
fast traders in case of a public information shock (Buti and Rindi, 2009). The former refers to a
situation where a competitor undercuts a large limit buy (sell) order by sending a limit buy (sell)
order at a slightly higher (lower) price (typically by the minimum tick size), thus gaining price
priority. Undisclosed orders help prevent undercutting by hiding order quantity. In the latter case,
supplying hidden liquidity would complicate the detection of mispriced orders (e.g., due to new
information arrival) that are likely to be exploited by scalpers. In one of the earliest studies, Aitken,
Berkman, and Mak (2001) analyze the Australian Stock Exchange and conclude that uninformed
liquidity suppliers use hidden quantity to reduce the option value of their limit orders (Copeland and
Galai, 1983) and thus protect themselves from parasitic traders. Bessembinder, Panayides, and Venkataraman (2009) and Pardo Tornero and Pascual (2011) show that traders use undisclosed orders to
manage exposure and pick off risk. De Winne and D'Hondt (2007) and Frey and Sandas (2008) fail to
ﬁnd any impact of private information on hidden liquidity provision.
Moinas (2010) proposes the ﬁrst theoretical model with private information to analyze the effect
of undisclosed orders on market performance and trader welfare. She builds a discrete sequential
model of trading with incomplete information and concludes that hidden liquidity is part of the
informed (insider) agent's equilibrium camouﬂage strategy. That analysis supports the idea that
undisclosed orders are driven by informational concerns, that is, not revealing private information to

94

the market through large orders that are likely to have a price impact. In a different setting, Boulatov
and George (2013) also focus on hidden liquidity provision under asymmetric information. They
predict that informed traders are more inclined to provide liquidity in opaque markets. Moinas (2010)
and Boulatov and George (2013) suggest improved liquidity through reduced pre-trade transparency.
Anand and Weaver (2004) show that informed traders use hidden liquidity to minimize price impacts
if trading activity is high using data from the Toronto Stock Exchange. Belter (2007) and Kumar,
Thirumalai, and Yadav (2009) also provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the use of
undisclosed orders may be information driven.
Overall, the literature on undisclosed orders is far from conclusive. Given the controversy,
experimental asset markets (e.g., Bloomﬁeld and O'Hara, 1999; BOS, 2005, 2009, 2015; Perotti and
Rindi, 2006) are instrumental when testing the main theoretical predictions on hidden liquidity,
which is not always possible with empirical data. This paper is one of the ﬁrst that attempts to ﬁll
this gap.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, I summarize the key theoretical predictions on
undisclosed orders. In Section 3, I describe the experimental design. In Section 4, I present the statistical analysis and the ﬁndings. I conclude in Section 5.

2. Predictions on undisclosed orders
Before I describe the details of my experimental design, I brieﬂy revisit the key predictions recent
theories provide on the source of undisclosed orders and the impact of opacity on market quality.
Prediction 1. Liquidity traders submit undisclosed orders to reduce the price impact of large orders
(Esser and Mönch, 2007).
Submitting an undisclosed order with a ﬁxed peak size is a dominant order-splitting strategy as
opposed to one splitting large limit orders because, given the time priority rule in the market, the
visible part of the undisclosed order is automatically executed. If this is the underlying reason for
hidden liquidity, I do not expect a signiﬁcant change in market liquidity.
Prediction 2. Liquidity traders submit undisclosed orders to avoid undercutting by other traders and to
compete for liquidity provision (Buti and Rindi, 2013).
If undisclosed orders are used to decrease price competition, the bid–ask spread widens because
orders at the best prices are not subject to undercutting and submission of undisclosed orders to the
second level of the book becomes optimal. While the depth at the top of the LOB increases, wider
spreads reduce the surplus of marketable orders, which in turn reduces trading volume. Moreover,
protection from undercutting results in higher trading proﬁts for liquidity traders, especially when
the tick size is large.
Prediction 3. Informed traders contribute to market liquidity in opaque markets (Moinas, 2010). In the
case of more than one informed trader, insiders compete for (hidden) liquidity provision (Boulatov and
George, 2013).
Informed liquidity suppliers often try to imitate the behavior of large liquidity traders to conceal
their private information, and thanks to undisclosed orders, they can enjoy the informational
advantage longer. According to Moinas's (2010) model, both informed and large liquidity suppliers
beneﬁt from opacity through an increase in depth and trading volume, but the author makes no
prediction on spreads. However, one limitation of the model is that insiders can only supply liquidity
and cannot take advantage of aggressive marketable orders. Boulatov and George (2013) conjecture
that opacity through undisclosed orders attracts informed traders to supply liquidity and the competition among insiders leads to lower bid–ask spreads and more informationally efﬁcient midquotes.

3. The experiment
The design of my asset market experiment takes into account recent theories on undisclosed
orders and focuses on three dimensions: trader types, transparency, and information asymmetry. In a
within-subject design, I control for three trader types and two transparency regimes. In the baseline
setting, I test the effects of market opacity on both trading strategies and market quality under
symmetric information. The analysis is extended by introducing informed trading. In this setting,
there is an additional trader type, that is, an informed trader, which allows me to compare the
transparency regimes under asymmetric information. Thus, using adverse selection, this experiment
is used to separate market friction from pre-trade transparency.
Under symmetric information, trading is isolated from motives related to private information. The
information structure is common knowledge; hence, there is no informational advantage across traders. In
this setting, one should observe hidden liquidity as part of an order-splitting strategy (Esser and Mönch,
2007), due to competition for liquidity provision (Buti and Rindi, 2013) and/or protection from fast traders
after public information release (Buti and Rindi, 2009). Under asymmetric information, adverse selection
arises via a single insider with superior information. This setup is closer to the environment envisaged by
Moinas (2010) theory, which suggests informational concerns behind hidden liquidity. I refer to Moinas's
model to convey the intuition in an environment with an informed trader. To test the sensitivity of the
results to a single monopolistic insider, I run additional sessions with two informed traders, which allows
competition among insiders (Boulatov and George, 2013).
3.1. Experimental asset markets
In this section, I describe the experimental design in detail and introduce main parameters of
experimental markets (see Online Appendix A for instructions). An experimental asset market is
deﬁned as a six-minute trading period. Traders in cohorts of six to eight traders attend a session
under a particular treatment that consists of a series of experimental markets called replications. I
introduce within-subject transparency manipulation: In all sessions, traders attend markets both
under a transparent regime (three to four replications), with no undisclosed order option, and an
opaque regime (three to four replications), with an undisclosed order option. The transparency

Table 2
Experimental design.
This table shows the parameter choices for different trader types. The initial endowment in each market is the sum of the
cash in experimental units and shares given to each trader type. For each trader type, the unconditional expected value of the
initial endowments is the same: the initial cash plus the number of shares times $45, that is, $7,375. Trading targets are deﬁned
per two-minute cycles, and remain the same during the six-minute trading period. Missing a target is penalized by subtracting
$1,000 per unfulﬁlled target from the ﬁnal payoff at the end of each market. The dividend distribution is common knowledge to
all trader types. Informed traders know the true state before trading starts.

treatment order is randomized; some cohorts start trading in transparent markets and others start in
opaque markets. The market regime is explicitly announced before each trading period.
In each market, one asset is chosen from the distribution shown in Table 1. At the beginning of
each trading period, the expected value of all securities is $45 (experimental currency). In line with
previous studies (e.g., BOS, 2005), the minimum tick size is ﬁxed at $1 in all experimental asset
markets. Trading starts with an empty book. Traders are endowed with different amounts of cash and
a number of securities, depending on the trader type, explained in the section below, but the
expected values of the initial endowment of each trader type are the same. Cash and shares of the
asset are given as a grant. In other words, the initial endowment is not subtracted from the ﬁnal cash
balances. This design allows no trading as a viable trading strategy. Unlike a dealership market,
traders are not required to submit two-sided quotes. They can simply choose to provide or consume
liquidity by taking one side of the trades. This feature reﬂects the electronic LOB mechanism common
to many modern trading venues, such as Euronext.
3.1.1. Information structure
There are three states in the world fL; M; Hg: A single asset has either a high, middle, or low level of
liquidation satisfying the following condition: M  L a H M. ex ante, each state is equally likely. A
three-state design is used to simplify the already complicated trading mechanism (Plott and Sunder,
1988). The distribution of liquidation value is common knowledge to all traders and known before
trading starts. One novel feature of my design is that an information event occurs in the middle of the
trading period.2 The experimenter releases the public information on the fundamental value of the
security; the average value of liquidating dividends moves either up or down by 10 experimental
currency units, that is,

The information event changes the expected fundamental value of the asset. Initially, six realizations are possible, which reduces to three equally likely outcomes once the information event
2
Even though the exact timing of the event is known to the market participants, the order revision cost, that is, the cost of
canceling orders, differs across trader types, which still allows one to pick off stale orders.

occurs. The information event exogenously widens the bid–ask spread during the trading period and
renders some of the outstanding limit orders obsolete. Thus I test how traders adjust their strategies
to changing market conditions under different transparency regimes and information settings.
3.1.2. Trading mechanism and the LOB
The trading mechanism is exactly the same under all treatments. Traders attend markets under
both transparent and opaque regimes in a random order. In transparent markets, traders can post
limit orders specifying the price, p A f1; …; 90g, and the quantity, q A f1; 2; …; 9; 10g. Traders can submit
block trades all at once, up to 10 shares. The submission of different order sizes is important in
studying competition for liquidity provision (Easley and O'Hara, 1987; Buti and Rindi, 2009, 2013).
Traders can also submit marketable orders stating only the quantity that hits the outstanding limit
orders. Marketable orders above (below) the best ask (bid) are completely executed at different
prices, given enough depth at those price levels. However, a marketable order at or inside the best bid
offer (BBO) does not walk up the book; that is, if the order quantity is greater than the quantity at the
best limit ask (bid), the remaining quantity after execution remains on the same side of the book. This
feature is similar to that of Euronext Paris. Limit orders reduce the price risk at the expense of
execution probability, while marketable orders facilitate execution, introducing price risk. In these
markets, ﬁrst price and then time priority rules apply: orders that improve trading price, that is, buy
(sell) orders submitted at higher (lower) prices, are executed ﬁrst, regardless of arrival time, and if
several orders are posted at the same price level, those that arrive ﬁrst are executed ﬁrst.
In opaque markets, traders can limit the quantity exposure by posting undisclosed orders, that is,
they can choose to hide their orders, but a predeﬁned portion of the order (peak size ¼1) remains
visible in the LOB. My design does not capture the trade-off between the optimal limit and the peak
size of an undisclosed order, which is the focus of a continuous time model proposed by Esser and
Mönch (2007). In opaque markets, ﬁrst price and then visibility and ﬁnally time priority rules apply.
Orders that improve trading price, that is, buy (sell) orders at higher (lower) prices, are executed ﬁrst,
regardless of arrival time, and if several orders are posted at the same price level, those that are
visible are executed ﬁrst, while the hidden part of undisclosed orders loses time priority against
visible limit orders that arrive later in the book. The visible part of the undisclosed orders, which is
equal to the peak size, does not lose time priority against other limit orders posted at the same price.
Every time the visible part is executed, another unit equal to the peak size becomes visible, until the
entire order is executed (see the example in Online Appendix B).
In both markets, orders can be canceled any time during the trading period. All price levels are
shown on the screen. All bids and ask prices are integers; hence, the tick size is one unit of experimental currency (BOS, 2005).3 I impose short sale restrictions and bankruptcy conditions. However,
traders are endowed with enough cash and securities and, hence, these conditions are rarely
binding.4
3.1.3. Trader types
In each market, traders are randomly assigned to a trader type. Under symmetric information,
there are three different types: traders with no exogenous trading motives, which I label uninformed,
and traders with either small or large trading targets, that is, small and large liquidity traders (BOS,
2005, 2009). Unlike previous studies, trading targets are imposed per two-minute cycles, so there are
three trading cycles in each market. Trading cycles over relatively long periods avoid situations in
which traders immediately fulﬁll their targets and behave randomly. Small liquidity traders should
either buy or sell eight shares per cycle. For large liquidity traders, the target is 20 shares per twominute cycle. There are equal numbers of buy and sell targets. This symmetric design implies a zero
aggregate net demand. The direction of the targets — buy or sell — remains the same during the sixminute trading periods. All traders are allowed to buy or sell, regardless of their targets, but liquidity
3
Empirical evidence on the effects of relative tick size is mixed (O'Hara, Saar, and Zhong, 2014). Online Appendix C shows
whether the relative tick size has an impact on hidden liquidity submission.

Short-sale constraints are binding only for 3% of liquidity traders.

traders are subject to a large penalty, $1,000 per unfulﬁlled target. The penalty is subtracted from the
end-of-period payoffs.5 I thus introduce heterogeneity among uninformed traders using trading
obligations (Bloomﬁeld and O'Hara, 1999; BOS, 2005). Liquidity traders transact for exogenous reasons related to the need to invest or to liquidate positions. Moreover, having liquidity traders with
different trading obligations helps me test the effect of trading aggressiveness on market outcomes
(Foucault, Kadan, and Kandel, 2005).
Each trader starts trading with an initial endowment. The ex ante expected value of the initial
endowments is $7,375 for all trader types. Uninformed traders start with $4,000 and 75 shares. Since
these traders are given cash and shares as a grant, they do not have exogenous reasons to trade. The
initial endowment composition of liquidity traders depends on the direction and magnitude of their
targets. For example, traders with buy targets start with more cash and fewer shares (see Table 2).
In asymmetric information sessions, a monopolistic insider replaces one uninformed trader. The
new trader type starts with the same initial endowment as the uninformed trader and has no trading
obligation. On top of the dividend distribution, the monopolistic insider knows the true state of the
world before each market starts. This gives the trader an informational advantage until the public
information release when the trader learns the true value of the liquidating dividend. Adverse
selection via a single informed trader allows me to investigate how the participation of an insider
(Kyle, 1985; Collin-Dufresne and Fos, 2015) affects liquidity dynamics and trading strategies under
different transparency regimes.6 In further sessions, I analyze trading once there is competition
among informed traders (Boulatov and George, 2013).
3.2. Participants and incentives
I run sessions with different incentive schemes. I ﬁrst conduct paid pilot sessions with 24 Tilburg
University students recruited through the CentER experimental laboratory. Pilot sessions lasted two
and a half hours and the participants were paid on average €10 per hour. Questionnaires after the ﬁrst
pilot sessions revealed that participants had difﬁculty understanding the trading mechanism using
undisclosed orders. Moreover, in these pilot sessions, the participants did not have enough training to
develop trading strategies. To overcome this problem, I designed a longitudinal study with students
who had a basic knowledge of the functioning of security exchanges.7
I ran the next sessions at Bocconi University with undergraduate students (N ¼72, 11 cohorts) who
attended a series of sessions as part of a market microstructure course requirement in 2009 (N ¼31,
ﬁve cohorts) and 2011 (N ¼41, six cohorts). In 2009, I presented the experiment as an opportunity to
increase one's course grade by one to three points (up to 20%), based on trading performance. A total
of 31 students committed themselves to attend a series of sessions for a month. The use of one's
course grade as an incentive scheme is controversial in experimental economics and ﬁnance; however, given the longitudinal nature of the experiment, grades provide a good scheme to guarantee
commitment for an extended period. Moreover, this incentive mechanism has the advantage of
introducing the possibility of loss, that is, obtaining no points after attending one month of trading
sessions (Kroll and Levy, 1992). In 2011, I repeated the same experiment, but this time introducing an
average payment of €12.5 per hour on top of the course grade incentive. I report the aggregate results
of both experiments below.8
Participants ﬁrst attended a lab session for the presentation of instructions and trading rules. The
training session lasted 90 minutes and participants had extensive interactive training with the trading
interface. They attended a second online training session to improve their familiarity with the trading

I do not allow for the partial fulﬁllment of trading targets; the same penalty applies even if traders miss their targets by
one share. Given the price grid, fulﬁlling the target is a dominant strategy (see Online Appendix D).

Insider trading is illegal in many countries, but in some countries such as in the United States, legal insider trading is
allowed under strict ﬁling requirements, such as SEC Form 4 or Schedule 13D ﬁling (Collin-Dufresne and Fos, 2015).
7
I ran another two-month pilot study with PhD students (N ¼6) who followed a market microstructure course. Their
performance in the trading experiment determined 15% of their course grade.

Separate analyses of the data reveal that the lack of monetary incentives did not change the participants' behavior in such
a way that would impair our inferences (results available upon request).

rules and to develop trading strategies. In the last three online sessions, participants traded under
three different settings, that is, under symmetric information, asymmetric information, and either
with auctions for private information (2009) or under asymmetric information with multiple insiders
(2011).9 In each session, participants are randomly assigned to a different cohort, but against traders
with the same experience level.
All participants start with some cash and a security endowment as explained above and the
interest rate is zero. Trading gains from one period are not transferred to other periods but are
recorded to calculate cumulative payoffs. Participants' earnings in each market are the liquidation
value of the assets they hold at the end of the trading period plus the capital gains (losses) obtained
through trading assets minus the ﬁxed penalty for not fulﬁlling each trading target. All price and
values are denominated in the laboratory currency. In the training sessions, I provided the participants with the explicit formula used to compute the payoffs. This ensured that they unambiguously
understood the incentives and how they related to trading. Participants’ grades and monetary payoffs
depended on their cumulative performance in all trading (except training) sessions.

4. Results
The statistical analysis is conducted at both the market and individual subject levels. Each of the
eleven cohorts is a single independent data point averaged over different replications under the same
market design, that is, opaque versus transparent. At the market level, I compare the within-cohort
differences of market quality measures (within-subjects design). I report the Wilcoxon signed-rank pvalues for the paired samples. At the individual level, for each participant, dependent variables are
aggregated under a relevant cell, that is, trader type  transparency, and the trading strategies of the
same participant are compared under different trading roles. This design allows me to control for
individual differences across participants. The results of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to
determine the effects of market structure on trading proﬁts under different information settings.

To calculate market quality measures, an algorithm merges orders from the LOB with transaction
data from the transaction book. All submitted limit, marketable, and undisclosed orders are collected
on a tick-by-tick basis. I reconstruct the LOB for outstanding orders and obtain snapshots of the LOB
for each second, which permits calculation of all depth-related measures at all price levels of the
electronic order book.
I compute liquidity, depth, and volatility measures separately to assess the impact of market
transparency and informational friction on market quality. As a liquidity measure, I proxy for message
trafﬁc using the total number of limit and marketable orders (and undisclosed orders under an
opaque regime) submitted to the LOB. I also report the total transacted volume in shares and the
number of shares per trade. The quoted bid–ask spread and effective spread reﬂect implicit transaction costs and the price impact of marketable orders. The latter is measured by P t  M t ðM t P t Þ for a
buy (sell) order, where Pt and Mt are the transaction price and the midquote (BOS, 2009). I decompose
the effective spread into temporary and permanent price impacts. The former is also known as the
realized spread and is measured by the distance between the transaction price and the midquote
prevailing after ﬁve trades, while the latter is the difference between the midquote and the midquote
prevailing after ﬁve trades. The (visible) depth is the total number of (visible) shares both at the BBO
and at all price levels of the LOB, labeled book depth. Finally, volatility is the sample estimate of the
standard deviation of prices using both the transaction price and the midquote.

Since trading starts with an empty book, there is a large accumulation of limit orders at the
beginning of each market. Limit shares show a downward trend during the trading period, exhibiting
cyclical spikes coinciding with trading targets. Marketable orders, on the other hand, do not show any
trend during the trading period. However, both limit and marketable shares move together around
trading cycles, that is, at the second and fourth minutes, reﬂecting both exogenous trading targets and
endogenous reactions to trading opportunities (Foucault, Kadan, and Kandel, 2005, 2013). Liquidity
provision decreases just before a public information release. This reduction is similar to the evidence
on anticipated news in equity (e.g., Graham, Koski, and Loewenstein, 2006; So and Wang, 2014) and
bond markets (e.g., Green, 2004; Engle, Fleming, Ghysels, and Nguyen, 2012). The sudden spike in
marketable orders after a public information release shows that traders respond very rapidly to news
and adjust to new fundamentals. The features are common under both symmetric and asymmetric
information.
Undisclosed orders exhibit a downward sloping pattern, which is consistent with the fact that they
lose time priority in execution. At the beginning of the trading period, when the book builds, spreads
are typically larger, with higher price volatility, and this is when I expect to see more extensive use of
undisclosed orders (Bessembinder, Panayides, and Venkataraman, 2009). Traders are also more likely
to submit undisclosed orders before public information release to avoid the risk of picking off stale
orders, but the use of undisclosed orders should increase as the time to news announcement
decreases (Buti and Rindi, 2009).10 In Panel A of Fig. 2, I compare the number of undisclosed orders
submitted in the ﬁrst and second halves of trading. The number decreases, on average, from 45 shares

On the contrary, Jiang, Lo, and Verdelhan (2011) document the withdrawal of hidden depth before news announcement
in U.S. Treasury bond markets.

to 23 shares (p-value o 0:000) under symmetric information and from 55 shares to 34 shares (p-value
o0:000) under asymmetric information. However, when I compare undisclosed orders right before
and after an information release, the decrease is less pronounced. An increase in undisclosed orders
under asymmetric information that persists through the last trading cycle hints at informational
motives behind hidden liquidity provision (Chakrabarty and Shaw, 2008). To explore this notion
further, I analyze trading strategies in Section 4.2.
Panel B in Fig. 2 shows the percentage of executed volume that consists of undisclosed orders. The
ﬁgure reveals that 17.8% to 19.5% of the executed volume in the experimental asset markets is
undisclosed, which is similar to the evidence documented in empirical studies (e.g., Frey and Sandas,
2008; Yao, 2013). While the ex ante probability of execution is lower for undisclosed orders, it seems
that undisclosed orders are submitted aggressively to the LOB and more so under symmetric information (Frey and Sandas, 2008; Hasbrouck and Saar, 2009).
4.2. Trading strategies
In Table 3, I report the average number of shares of limit, marketable, and undisclosed orders
submitted by each trader type under symmetric information. The focus is on competition for liquidity
provision and trader aggressiveness. I report four different measures: (i) the number of limit orders
submitted inside the bid–ask spread that improves the best price, (ii) the number of limit orders
submitted at the BBO, (iii) the average distance of limit orders to the prevailing midquote, and (iv) the
average distance of undisclosed orders to the prevailing midquote conditional on submission
(Bessembinder, Panayides, and Venkataraman, 2009).

Fig. 3. Trading proﬁts: This ﬁgure shows the average trading proﬁts of each trader type. The trading proﬁt is the ﬁnal payoff net
of the initial endowment. Panel A exhibits the trading proﬁts in markets under symmetric information, that is, no insider
trader, and I compare proﬁts across transparent and opaque markets. Panel B exhibits trading proﬁts in markets under
asymmetric information, that is, with one insider, and I compare proﬁts across transparent and opaque markets.

In my asset markets, exogenous trading targets constrain liquidity traders' behavior. In principle,
liquidity traders should be more active in trading by participating not only in liquidity demand but
also in liquidity provision. This is what I observe in Table 3 under both transparent and opaque
regimes. Since liquidity traders, especially large ones, have exogenous trading motives, they also trade
faster and provide liquidity more aggressively at the top levels of the book. The difference between
transparent and opaque regimes is that traders also have the option to provide liquidity using
undisclosed orders. Large liquidity traders use this option and shift about 20% of liquidity supply to
undisclosed orders. It seems that they follow a mixed strategy of using both limit and undisclosed
orders for liquidity provision, together with marketable orders to satisfy their liquidity needs and
guarantee execution. Undisclosed orders allow liquidity traders to reduce order exposure and to
control price risk and therefore complement both limit and marketable orders. However, at the same
time, they reduce the execution probability due to the visibility priority rule. Large liquidity traders
act strategically and improve execution probability by submitting limit orders more aggressively,
rather than demanding more liquidity through marketable orders.
Traditionally, informed traders are associated with short-lived information and are hence perceived as impatient traders who would like to exploit informational advantages as quickly as possible
by consuming liquidity. However, researchers (BOS, 2005; Kaniel and Liu, 2006; Rindi, 2008; Boulatov
and George, 2013) suggest that informed traders contribute substantially to liquidity provision, particularly when the information is sufﬁciently persistent. If used strategically, undisclosed orders may
increase the life of private information by concealing trading motives (Moinas, 2010). The results
reported in Table 4 under asymmetric information suggest that informed traders indeed act strategically and pool with large liquidity traders in both liquidity provision and consumption under a

transparent regime. In terms of submitted shares, I do not observe signiﬁcant differences between
large liquidity and informed traders. In other words, informed traders are as active as large liquidity
traders in liquidity provision (Menkhoff, Osler, and Schmeling, 2010). This evidence suggests ﬁerce
competition, that is, a race to trade (Boulatov and George, 2013) between two trader types for
liquidity provision. Notably, under an opaque regime, informed traders are less active in liquidity
provision through visible limit orders and act less aggressively: They submit fewer limit orders that
improve prices (inside spread) so that they can exploit their informational advantage as long as
possible. They also exploit undisclosed orders to provide liquidity. However, I observe substantial
heterogeneity among insiders (e.g., Cohen, Malloy, and Pomorski, 2012), and some informed traders
do not use undisclosed orders at all. Once submitted, however, informed traders use undisclosed
orders in larger quantities, further from the prevailing midquote.

Table 7
Pre-trade transparency under symmetric information.
This table reports the mean and median values for various market quality measures under symmetric information. I compare
transparent and opaque markets using a paired sample analysis (11 cohorts) and report one sided Wilcoxon signed-rank p-values.
I compute message trafﬁc as the sum of limit, marketable, and undisclosed orders (in case of opaque markets) submitted to the
LOB, the total transacted volume in shares, and the number of shares per trade. I report quoted bid–ask spread for the entire
trading period, for each trading cycle, and each minute. Cycle 1, 2, and 3 refer to the trading period between 1–120 seconds, 121–
240 seconds, and 241–360 seconds, respectively. The effective (realized) spread is the distance between the transaction price and
the midquote (prevailing after ﬁve trades). The permanent price impact is the difference between the midquote and the midquote
prevailing after ﬁve trades. (Visible) BBO depth refers to the (visible) shares at the BBO, while (visible) book depth consists of the
(visible) shares at all levels of the LOB. Price (midquote) volatility is the standard deviation of transaction prices (midquotes). pvalues less than 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01 indicate signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

4.3. Trading proﬁts
The general conclusion that can be drawn from current models is that opacity via undisclosed
orders improves the welfare of the market participants. In the absence of informed traders, Buti and
Rindi (2013) predict that liquidity traders, especially large ones, beneﬁt from opaque markets. Models
under adverse selection (Moinas, 2010; Boulatov and George, 2013) make a similar prediction for both
informed and uninformed traders.
I measure trading proﬁts at the individual subject level for each trader type and compute proﬁts as
the ﬁnal payoff net of the initial endowment.11 Panel A in Fig. 3 exhibits the trading proﬁts in markets
under symmetric information and compares proﬁts across transparent and opaque regimes. Liquidity
traders, especially large ones, are better off in opaque markets at the expense of uninformed traders.
11
I elicit traders' risk preferences following Holt and Laury (2002) procedure. The average number of safe choices (n ¼69)
is 4.74, which suggests slightly risk-averse behavior. Therefore, I believe that trading proﬁt is a good approximation for
measuring subjects' utility.

Table 8
Pre-trade transparency under asymmetric information.
This table reports the mean and median values for various market quality measures under asymmetric information. I
compare transparent and opaque markets using a paired sample analysis (11 cohorts) and report one sided Wilcoxon signedrank p-values. I compute message trafﬁc as the sum of limit, marketable, and undisclosed orders (in case of opaque markets)
submitted to the LOB, the total transacted volume in shares, and the number of shares per trade. I report quoted bid–ask spread
for the entire trading period, for each trading cycle and each minute. Cycle 1, 2, and 3 refer to the trading period between 1–120
seconds, 121–240 seconds, and 241–360 seconds, respectively. The effective (realized) spread is the distance between the
transaction price and the midquote (prevailing after ﬁve trades). The permanent price impact is the difference between the
midquote and the midquote prevailing after ﬁve trades. (Visible) BBO depth refers to (visible) shares at the BBO, while (visible)
book depth consists of the (visible) shares at all levels of the LOB. Price (midquote) volatility is the standard deviation of
transaction prices (midquotes). n, nn, and nnn, indicate signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

The increase in trading proﬁts for large liquidity traders is in line with Buti and Rindi (2013) prediction, but the mechanism generating differences in proﬁts seems to be different. In Online Appendix
F.1, I decompose the trading proﬁts into “make and take” proﬁts, that is, proﬁts through limit orders
versus marketable orders, respectively. I see that market making for uninformed traders is less
proﬁtable under an opaque regime, which leads to the difference in total proﬁts across the two
transparency regimes. On the other hand, large liquidity traders suffer losses, on average, through
limit orders under both transparent and opaque regimes. While the make losses are more pronounced under an opaque regime, liquidity consumption is more proﬁtable. Differences in trading
proﬁts across transparency regimes are likely to arise due to differences in implicit transaction costs
across regimes. Therefore, in the next section, I compare different measures of liquidity across
transparency regimes.
As a formal analysis, I run an ANOVA to test the effects of market design on trading proﬁts under
symmetric information. The dependent variable is the trader's payoff relative to the average market
payoff normalized by the unconditional expected payoff ($7,375). The independent variables include
trader type — uninformed, small liquidity (buy/sell), large liquidity (buy/sell) — opacity (transparent
vs. opaque), and extremity (whether the state is extreme or not), and four interaction terms. An asset

Fig. 4. Aggregate trading strategies under symmetric information: In this ﬁgure, I compare the average (median) liquidity
make, take, and aggressiveness in transparent and opaque markets under symmetric information. Liquidity make is proxied by
the submission rate, that is, the sum of submitted limit orders (plus undisclosed orders in opaque markets) over total orders.
The take rate is the sum of submitted marketable orders over limit orders (plus undisclosed orders in opaque markets). The
limit order aggressiveness is the average distance between the limit order price and the prevailing midquote at the time of
order submission. The data are aggregated over 60-second time intervals. The vertical line indicates the time of the public
information release about the ﬁnal dividend distribution. The dashed (solid) line shows the transparent (opaque) markets.

is classiﬁed as extreme if the liquidating dividend is more than 20% from the unconditional mean
(BOS, 2005). The results are shown in Table 5. Neither trader type nor market opacity alone affects
trader proﬁts. It is also not surprising that the extremity variable is not signiﬁcant, since none of the
traders have superior information in these markets. The only signiﬁcant variable is the interaction
term, type  opacity, suggesting that market opacity has different implications for different trader
types, consistent with the evidence above.
I repeat the same analysis under asymmetric information. Panel B in Fig. 3 shows that informed
traders, on average, earn more than the other trader types. This result is expected, since in my
experimental markets informed traders have a clear informational advantage and they seem to be
able to extract an informational rent. Interestingly though, they are, on average, better off under an
opaque regime at the expense of large liquidity traders. The decomposition in Online Appendix Table
F.2 also shows that opacity adversely affects both the make and take proﬁts of large liquidity traders.
Hence, unlike markets under symmetric information, once information friction is introduced, large
liquidity traders are worse off due to reduced transparency, which is in contrast with Moinas (2010)
prediction. The ANOVA results in Table 6 indicate that trader type, particularly an informed one,

especially when the information is more valuable.

Fig. 6. Order cancelation. In this ﬁgure, I compare the order cancelation rates in transparent and opaque markets under
symmetric and asymmetric information. The cancel to make rate is the proportion of limit orders (plus undisclosed orders in
opaque markets) that are canceled. The bars show the cancel-to-make rate both for the entire period, and for the period after
the public information release, that is, the last three minutes of trading.

4.4. Market quality
An important regulatory concern is how a reduction in pre-trade transparency of the ﬁnancial
markets affects market quality (e.g., Madhavan, Porter, and Weaver, 2005; Foucault, Pagano, and Röell,
2010; Gozluklu, 2013). In light of the theoretical predictions summarized in Section 2, I now turn to
the analysis of changes in market quality due to pre-trade opacity introduced via undisclosed orders.
Market quality is measured along different dimensions, that is, liquidity, depth, and volatility, as
deﬁned in Section 4.
Table 7 reports both the mean and median values of different market quality measures under
transparent and opaque regimes and symmetric information. Trading activity and volatility measures
are not sensitive to market transparency. Book depth, on average, is higher (yet not signiﬁcant) in
opaque markets, while visible book depth is lower, reﬂecting the reduction in market transparency.
The average trade size is similar across transparency regimes, suggesting that order splitting cannot
be the main motive (Prediction 1) behind hidden liquidity. The main change induced by opacity is the
reduction of quoted spreads (by almost a quarter tick, on average) and, in particular, the realized
spread, capturing the temporary price impact of marketable orders (p-value ¼ 0.087). Improved
liquidity is broadly in line with the increased market participation of liquidity traders with undisclosed orders to avoid the risk of being picked off. However, the risk of being picked off cannot alone
explain the reduction in spreads. First, traders have other means of avoiding exposure risk, via order
cancelation. Second, there is no signiﬁcant increase in undisclosed orders before information release.
Finally, Online Appendix Table G.1 also shows the displayed and undisclosed ﬁll rates of submitted
orders for both the entire trading period and one minute after information release. While the ﬁll rates
are lower for displayed orders for the entire trading period, I do not observe a signiﬁcant decrease in
ﬁll rates right after information release.
A reduction in spreads is in contrast with Prediction 2, which suggests an increase in spreads due
to price competition via undisclosed orders. Given the balanced nature of the trading targets, that is,
equal numbers of buy and sell targets, liquidity traders in these markets coordinate to satisfy their
liquidity needs rather than compete; hence, there is no increase in the bid–ask spread as predicted by
Buti and Rindi (2013). Further inspection into the dynamic evolution of liquidity shows that the
reduction in spreads in opaque markets is mainly concentrated around the deadlines of trading
targets, especially at the end of the trading period (p-value ¼0.005). In the next section, I analyze
dynamic trading strategies to see how they affect aggregate market outcomes.
Under asymmetric information, most of the market outcomes are insensitive to the transparency regime
(see Table 8). Only the average trade size decreases signiﬁcantly (p-value¼0.087), reﬂecting the participation
of both liquidity and informed traders in hidden liquidity provision. Since both large liquidity and informed
traders join the race for liquidity provision, there is an increase in book depth (Prediction 3), but this result is

Table 9
Pre-trade transparency under asymmetric information (two insiders).
This table reports the mean and median values for various market quality measures under asymmetric information with two
insiders. I compare transparent and opaque markets using a paired sample analysis (six cohorts) and report one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank p-values. I compute message trafﬁc as the sum of limit, marketable, and undisclosed orders (in case of
opaque markets) submitted to the LOB, the total transacted volume in shares, and the number of shares per trade. I report
quoted bid–ask spread for the entire trading period, for each trading cycle and each minute. Cycle 1, 2, and 3 refer to the trading
period between 1–120 seconds, 121–240 seconds, and 241–360 seconds, respectively. The effective (realized) spread is the
distance between the transaction price and the midquote (prevailing after ﬁve trades). The permanent price impact is the
difference between the midquote and the midquote prevailing after ﬁve trades. BBO depth refers to shares at Best Bid Offer
(BBO), while (visible) book depth are the (visible) shares at all levels of the LOB. Price (midquote) volatility is the standard
deviation of transaction prices (midquotes). n, nn, and nnn, indicate signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

only statistically signiﬁcant when there is more than one informed trader (discussed later in Section 4.6).
Importantly, I do not detect a decrease in spreads, either in quoted or in the realized spreads, over the entire
trading period, except the period around a public information announcement. Spreads around the information event are lower, on average, by more than one tick under an opaque regime. This is the period when
liquidity traders are exposed to more adverse selection risk. The ﬁll rates in Online Appendix Table G.2 show
that uninformed and liquidity traders exploit undisclosed orders to protect themselves against adverse
selection. On the other hand, the monopolistic insider can exploit the informational rent longer in opaque
markets, thanks to the undisclosed orders. Rather than acting aggressively using marketable orders to beneﬁt
from the informational advantage, the insider can pool with liquidity traders and provide liquidity more
aggressively. The insider can thus increase the execution probability without revealing private information. I
can thereby observe the reduction in spreads around the release of public information. Overall, the results
indicate that informational friction is an important dimension in the transparency debate.12

12
In Online Appendix H, I show that how insider trading increases adverse selection costs, that is, an increase in volatility
and bid–ask spread, regardless of the transparency regime.

Fig. 7. Value discovery. This ﬁgure shows the average deviation of midquotes from the fundamental asset value after the public
information release. The deviation is the absolute difference between the midquote in each second, and true dividend normalized by the range of dividend distribution. Panel A shows the data under asymmetric information with a monopolistic
insider. Panel B shows the data under asymmetric information with two insiders. The data are aggregated over 30-second time
intervals.

4.5. From trading to market outcomes
Unlike the experimental evidence provided by BOS (2015), I observe not only the sensitivity of
trading strategies to transparency regimes, but also that some of the market outcomes are driven by
both the transparency regime and informational friction. However, it is important to highlight the
differences in experimental design between the BOS (2015) study and mine. First, the composition of
traders is not the same: BOS's (2015) design includes only two types of traders: liquidity and
informed. Second, the information structure is different. In BOS's (2015) experiment, the informed
traders participate in all markets, hence there is no symmetric information setting. Third, informed
traders are not insiders but receive an imprecise signal about the fundamental value of the asset. Last
but not least, in BOS's (2015) study markets are open for three minutes, without a public information
release in the middle of trading.
To see how aggregate trading affects market outcomes, I report liquidity make and take measures
that reﬂect the aggregate order choice. Liquidity make is proxied by the submission rate, which is the
sum of submitted limit orders (and undisclosed orders in opaque markets) over total orders. The take
rate, on the other hand, is the sum of submitted marketable orders over limit orders (and undisclosed
orders in opaque markets). Limit order aggressiveness captures the impatience of the average market
participant (Foucault, Kadan, and Kandel, 2005). It is measured by the average distance between the
limit order price and the prevailing midquote at the time of order submission. While aggressive
liquidity provision reduces spreads, liquidity consumption has the opposite effect on market liquidity.
In Fig. 4, I compare order submission strategies in transparent and opaque markets under symmetric information over one-minute time intervals. The vertical line indicates the time of the public
information release about the ﬁnal dividend distribution. The submission rates are very similar across

112

A.E. Gozluklu / Journal of Financial Markets 28 (2016) 91–115

transparency regimes. The signiﬁcant reduction in spreads toward the end of two-minute cycles in
opaque markets (see Table 7) coincides with the period when traders supply liquidity more
aggressively rather than switch to marketable orders. There is a reduction in spreads when traders try
to increase the execution probability of limit orders by submission to the top of the book. Right after
information release, the mispricing of stale orders is corrected. In opaque markets, due to the greater
accumulation of limit orders before the announcement, limit orders are submitted less aggressively
after the information release, but more orders are picked off with marketable orders. The overall
effect is a larger (but insigniﬁcant) spread in opaque markets right after the release of public information. This implies that, in the absence of information asymmetry, opacity affects market outcomes
mainly through the strategic choice of order aggressiveness. Dynamic strategies reﬂect the trade-off
between waiting costs and the cost of immediacy, that is, bid–ask spreads, and conﬁrm the intuition
that mainly aggressive limit orders drive the evolution of spreads (Foucault, Kadan, and Kandel,
2005).
Fig. 5 shows dynamic order submission strategies in transparent and opaque markets under
asymmetric information. It also separately shows the strategies of informed traders (lines with star
symbols). First, I see that informed traders act differently from all the other market participants: They
are very active in liquidity provision, especially around the information event, but they do not
necessarily supply liquidity aggressively. Monopolistic insiders also engage heavily in liquidity consumption right after the information release to exploit their informational advantage, but they
manage to pool with large liquidity traders and increase the execution probability of their informed
orders by submitting more aggressive limit orders in opaque markets, rather than exploiting marketable orders. Hence, there is a signiﬁcant decrease in bid–ask spreads after the release of public
information under asymmetric information.13
Outstanding limit orders can also be revised through order cancelation. Fig. 6 shows cancel-tomake rate under symmetric and asymmetric information. The ﬁgure shows that traders cancel more
orders in opaque markets regardless of the information setting, especially in the second half of
trading. In other words, cancel-to-make rate provides further evidence that market opacity helps
traders reduce exposure costs.

4.6. Competition between insiders
The results reported so far rely on a monopolistic informed trader. As a robustness test, I run
additional session with two insiders. One can argue that competition among informed traders could
lead to different market outcomes that would not arise in a market with a single informed trader
(Boulatov and George, 2013). To alleviate this concern, I repeat the analysis in Section 4.4, analyzing
the implication of opacity on market quality under asymmetric information with two insiders.
The results in Table 9 are broadly in line with those in Table 8. One difference, however, is that
increasing the degree of adverse selection results in increased book depth in opaque markets (pvalue ¼ 0.016) without much affecting the spreads. This result is consistent with the previous
empirical evidence from the Toronto Stock Exchange (Anand and Weaver, 2004) and the experimental
ﬁndings of BOS (2015). Under an opaque regime, quoted spreads are lower, on average, by half a tick
(but not statistically signiﬁcantly) and, unlike markets with a monopolistic insider, spreads are similar
around public news releases across transparency regimes. However, opacity has a signiﬁcant impact
on effective spreads, mainly through the reduction of a permanent price impact. It seems that ﬁerce
competition for liquidity provision among insiders accelerates the incorporation of information into
prices under an opaque regime.

13
I do not observe a signiﬁcant effect on spreads in the ﬁrst trading cycle, because until the informed traders become
insiders, trading strategies vary greatly.

A.E. Gozluklu / Journal of Financial Markets 28 (2016) 91–115

4.7. Informational efﬁciency
An important function of efﬁcient markets is to aggregate information and reﬂect the true fundamental value of traded assets. Undisclosed orders could hinder value discovery if they are predominantly used by informed traders to conceal their informed trades. However, if all market participants opt for hidden liquidity, then the effect on information efﬁciency will not be clear. In fact, the
evidence so far is mixed (Ye, 2012; Zhu, 2014; BOS, 2015; Comerton-Forde and Putnins, 2015).
The public news announcement in the experimental design allows me to test how information is
incorporated into prices through trading under different transparency regimes. The informational
efﬁciency of the markets is proxied by the average deviation of midquotes from the fundamental asset
value once the news is made public. The deviation is measured as the absolute difference between the
midquote and the true dividend normalized by the range of the dividend distribution.
In the presence of a monopolistic insider, midquotes converge monotonically to the true liquidating dividend after the information event. Panel A of Fig. 7 reveals that market transparency does
not affect the informational efﬁciency of the markets. The monopolistic insider competes with other
large liquidity traders and follows pooling strategies to maximize the informational advantage. The
use of undisclosed orders at lower levels of the book does not help with the value discovery. The
situation is different when there is competition among insiders for liquidity provision. Panel B of
Fig. 7 shows that value discovery is faster under opaque markets with shared informational rents,
where competition for liquidity provision is more intense (Boulatov and George, 2013). Market
opacity induces informed traders to provide liquidity more aggressively, which leads to more informative transaction prices.14

5. Conclusion
In my experimental asset markets, traders exploit undisclosed orders to enrich their strategy set.
Undisclosed orders not only help liquidity traders reduce order exposure but also control the price
risk. Hence they complement both limit and marketable orders. In opaque markets, liquidity traders
improve execution probabilities by managing limit order aggressiveness. Under asymmetric information, monopolistic insiders compete with large liquidity traders for liquidity provision and, even
though a subset of informed traders rely on hidden liquidity, opaque markets help insiders trade less
aggressively.
The market transparency increases the trading proﬁts of large liquidity traders in opaque markets
under symmetric information. While a liquidity trader submits directional orders in line with her
trading target, an uninformed trader operates on both sides of the LOB. The reduced cost of immediacy via lower spreads in opaque markets helps liquidity traders and is detrimental for uninformed
ones. On the contrary, under adverse selection, large liquidity traders are worse off from reduced
transparency, especially if the information is owned by a single insider. An insider is better at
exploiting her informational advantage in an opaque market.
My results show that the effect of undisclosed orders on market quality largely depends on
informational friction. Without an insider, a reduction in transparency contributes positively to
market liquidity by reducing spreads, especially toward the end of trading. On the other hand, under
asymmetric information, the effect of market opacity on liquidity is mostly visible around the release
of public news. Increasing the degree of adverse selection also results in increased book depth in
opaque markets. Limiting pre-trade transparency can be beneﬁcial for securities that are less exposed
to private information, for example, large ﬁrms and bonds; however, in markets with a potential for
asymmetric information, for example, higher institutional participation or small ﬁrms, undisclosed
14
This result regarding informational efﬁciency differs from that of BOS (2015). The difference may be due to the fact that,
in my setting, insider traders know the fundamental value of the asset, as opposed to informed traders who receive a signal
about the true value, as in BOS's study (2015).

114

A.E. Gozluklu / Journal of Financial Markets 28 (2016) 91–115

orders do not necessarily improve market quality, except around information-sensitive periods,
unless there is ﬁerce competition among informed traders.
Finally, I show that the value discovery is also sensitive to the degree of asymmetric information.
In the case of a monopolistic insider, the market transparency does not change the informational
efﬁciency of the markets, while value discovery is faster under opaque markets when informational
rents are shared between insiders.
