Abstract
This paper explores the explanatory power of Jensen’s free cash flow hypothesis in
managers’ choice of LIFO versus FIFO. The association between FCF, and choice of
inventory methods is based on the assumption that there is a potential conflict of interest
between managers and shareholders when LIFO is the tax minimization method and that
non-value-maximizing managers of firms with the FCF problem have incentives to choose
FIFO, an income increasing method, in order to increase their compensation. However,
since debt can act as a monitoring device and mitigate the agency problems of FCF,
managers of firms with high FCF and high debt are less likely to choose FIFO than
managers of firms with high FCF and low debt. The evidence is consistent with this
expectation. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
An important strand of corporate finance and accounting research examines
agencyrcontracting explanations for managers’ choice of corporate policies such
as debt, dividend, compensation and accounting policies ŽSmith and Watts, 1992;
Skinner, 1993.. In particular, choice of accounting policies has been the focus of

some research interest. This paper focuses on managers’ choice of inventory
methods LIFO versus FIFO. Although prior studies provide some insight on why
firms select LIFO, the understanding as to why firms remain on FIFO is still
unclear and subject to some controversy ŽBiddle, 1989; Niehaus, 1989; Cushing
and LeClere, 1992; Christie and Zimmerman, 1994.. 1 This paper attempts to
provide an explanation for managers’ choice of LIFOrFIFO by drawing on
Jensen’s Ž1986. Free Cash Flow ŽFCF. theory. FCF is defined as the excess cash
available after mangers have invested in net present value ŽNPV. projects ŽRubin,
1990, p. 81.. According to Jensen Ž1986, 1989., low growthrhigh FCF firms face
an agency problem in the sense that managers indulge in ‘ value-destroying
activities’ such as increasing their perquisites, investing in negative NPV projects
and generally acting against shareholders’ interests. Jensen Ž1993, p. 849. also
asserts that lucrative compensation and benefits are other ways in which the
agency costs of FCF can manifest themselves. This suggests that managers of low
growthrhigh FCF firms are more likely to choose FIFO, an income increasing
method, rather than LIFO in order to receive higher compensation. Other reasons
why non-value-maximizing managers may choose FIFO include job security
ŽWeisbach, 1988; Christie and Zimmerman, 1994. and the need to mask nonvalue-maximizing expenditure from outsiders ŽChristie and Zimmerman, 1994..
Jensen Ž1986, 1989. also argues that debt can mitigate the agency problems
between shareholders and managers of firms with the FCF problem and motivate
management to act in the interests of the shareholders. Debt not only reduces the
FCF but also provides discipline to management through the debt market. This
debt monitoring hypothesis is formalized by Harris and Raviv Ž1990. and Stulz
Ž1990. and empirically demonstrated by Maloney et al. Ž1993. and Gul and Tsui
Ž1998.. Following the debt monitoring hypothesis, managers of firms with the FCF
problem and high debt are less likely to choose FIFO Žand act against the interest
of the shareholders., than managers of firms with the FCF problem and low levels
of debt, ceteris paribus.2
The above reasoning regarding the role of FCF and debt monitoring was also
examined by Gul and Tsui Ž1998. in a recent audit pricing study. They tested the
hypothesis that there will be a positive association between FCF and audit fees and
that the positive association is weaker for firms with higher levels of debt. They

1
Four hypotheses have been advanced for inventory accounting choices. These are the efficiency
contracting hypothesis ŽSkinner, 1993., the tax hypothesis ŽCushing and LeClere, 1992., the political
costs hypothesis ŽDopuch and Pincus, 1988; Lee and Hsieh, 1985. and the agency or opportunistic
hypothesis ŽAbdel-khalik, 1985; Skinner, 1993..
2
This prediction runs counter to the debt covenant hypothesis which suggests that managers will
choose income-increasing methods in order to loosen debt covenants. An extension of this prediction in
the context of the debt hypothesis suggests that models used in prior studies may have an omitted
variables problem by not explicitly considering the FCF problem Žsee, for example, Skinner, 1993 who
did not find any significant results for the debtrinventory method relationship..

argued that since managers of low growthrhigh FCF firms are involved in
non-value maximizing activities they are also expected to mask non-optimal
expenditures by accounting manipulations Žp. 220.. Thus, auditors respond to the
higher probability of accounting misstatements by exerting greater audit effort and
charging higher audit fees. However, the existence of debt as a monitoring device
for low growthrhigh FCF firms is expected to mitigate the FCF agency problems
and thus reduce the positive association between FCF and audit fees. The results
of their study are consistent with the hypotheses. The same reasoning is applied to
managers’ choice of LIFOrFIFO.
Five proxies for growth are factor analyzed in order to obtain investment
opportunity set ŽIOS. index. Firms with scores at the bottom quartile are categorized as low growth. The values for the independent variables, FCF and debt and
the control variables size, inventory materiality, current ratio, average tax loss
carryforward and return on assets are obtained by averaging the observations from
Compustat for the years 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980. Appropriate adjustments are
made to all the relevant variables for LIFO firms to convert them to a FIFO basis.
The dependent variable is the firm’s inventory method, LIFO Žcoded 0. versus
FIFO Žcoded 1. for the year 1980. Niehaus Ž1989. also examines LIFOrFIFO
choice for the same year and provides information on compensation and industries
facing price declines. The information on compensation provides the basis for the
assumption in the paper that managers would prefer FIFO in order to improve
their compensation, ceteris paribus.
Logistic regressions are used to test the hypothesis. The significant negative
interaction results between FCF and debt for low growth firms suggest that
increasing levels of both debt and FCF are associated with a lower likelihood of
managers choosing FIFO. These results are consistent with Jensen’s Ž1986, 1989.
FCF theory and the debt monitoring hypothesis.
Another explanation for the results which draws from the debt covenant
hypothesis may also be considered. Managers of firms with high debt and high
FCF are less likely to choose FIFO than managers of high debt and low FCF
because firms with high FCF are less likely to be close to debt covenant violations
than firms with low FCF. The coefficients for debt in all the regressions are
significant and positive. It is not possible to completely rule out this explanation
but two reasons suggest that the FCF and debt monitoring is a more plausible
explanation. First, the significant interaction results were only found for the low
growth subsample and not for the high growth subsample. Second, a logistic
regression with the full sample Ž N s 285. shows that the interaction term for FCF
and debt is insignificant.3
Section 2 provides the theoretical background for the paper and Section 3
discusses the research method including variables specification. This is followed in

Section 4 by the data analyses and results. Section 5 presents a discussion and
summary of the results.

2. Theoretical background
Two assumptions that provide the basis for the theoretical relationship between
FCF, debt and choice of inventory methods are Ž1. that shareholders prefer
managers to choose the inventory method that minimizes taxable income, Ž2. that
managers prefer the inventory method that maximizes reported income to increase
accounting based compensation ŽAbdel-khalik, 1985; Niehaus, 1989..4 Shareholders’ preference may be explained by the fact that lower tax liability implies a
higher share price, and managers’ preference may be explained in terms of the fact
that higher reported income increases earnings-based compensation, ceteris paribus.
A reasonable assumption is that managers’ compensation increases with reported
income ŽAbdel-khalik, 1985; Niehaus, 1989..5 The link between low growthrhigh
FCF and choice of FIFO is based on Jensen’s Ž1993. suggestion that one
manifestation of the FCF problem is managers’ incentives for higher compensation.
When FIFO minimizes taxes, a conflict of interest between the shareholders
and managers is unlikely since FIFO can be chosen for tax purposes and LIFO for
financial reporting purposes. However, when LIFO minimizes taxes, there is a
potential conflict of interest between the shareholders and mangers since if LIFO
is used in tax reporting it must also be used for financial reporting. The
management compensation assumption implies that managers prefer FIFO. The
likelihood that this potential conflict would be resolved in favor of the shareholders of low growth firms depends on the extent of the FCF problem and the firm’s
level of debt.6 A natural extension of the FCF agency problem is to say that
non-value-maximizing managers of firms with low growthrhigh FCF are more
likely to choose FIFO, an income increasing method. Other possible incentives for
managers’ choice of FIFO include job security since the probability of replacing
managers is higher for firms with poor accounting earnings performance ŽWarner
et al., 1988; Weisbach, 1988; Murphy and Zimmerman, 1993. and the significant
role of accounting numbers in proxy contests between managers and dissident
shareholders ŽDeAngelo, 1988, 1990.. Accounting procedures are also used by
4

The political costs argument would suggest that managers of larger firms would prefer income
decreasing methods.
5
Healy et al. Ž1987. found no evidence that compensation committees make bonuses contingent on
the inventory method used by managers.
6
Since it is difficult to observe whether or not a conflict of interest actually exists, this hypothesis is
an indirect test of the relationships.

managers to mask non-value-maximizing expenditures from outsiders ŽShleifer
and Vishny, 1989; Christie and Zimmerman, 1994..
However, at high levels of debt, greater monitoring increases the likelihood that
managers have incentives to make decisions that are more consistent with the
interests of shareholders ŽJensen, 1989; Maloney et al., 1993..7 This suggests that
managers are more likely to choose LIFO, which minimizes tax and increases the
value of the shareholders’ wealth.

3. Research methodology
3.1. Sample selection
Observations for this study are based on data collected from the PC Plus
version of Compustat. In order to avoid the confounding effects of regulation on
choice of inventory methods regulated firms with the following four digit SIC are
excluded from the analysis: Ž1. 100–1400 Žmining firms., Ž2. 4011 Žrailroads., Ž3.
4911–4991 Žutilities., Ž4. 6021–8744 Žfinancial, medical and other service firms..
Another requirement for the firm to be included in the sample is that it is publicly
traded, incorporated in the US, is not a subsidiary of another firm and information
on inventory methods is available. Information on inventory accounting methods
used by firms is also obtained from Compustat, which identifies seven different
inventory valuation methods.8 For purposes of this study, only those firms that
selected and retained LIFO or FIFO as the Aprimary methodB for the years
1977–1981 are selected. As a result of this procedure, 794 firm observations are
available. Of these, 352 firm observations met all the criteria for the measurement
of the IOS variable. The bottom quartile of this sample in terms of the IOS scores
is selected to represent the low growth category of firms Ž N s 88.. These 88 firms
are used to run the regressions but are reduced as a result of any missing values
for any of the variables in the overall regressions leaving 74 low growth firms.
Table 1 presents the industry representations of the firms in the sampling frame
and firms in the low growth category.
3.2. Specification and measurement of Õariables
The inventory method choice selected for study is for those reported at the
fiscal year-end 1980. Two reasons motivated the choice of this year. First, Niehaus
7

Jensen Ž1989. also draws attention to the fact that managers of firms with high debt are more likely
to be rewarded on the basis of cash flow of the firm rather than accounting earnings.

The following seven inventory valuation methods have been identified by Compustat: FIFO, LIFO,
Specific Identification, Average Cost, Retail Method, Standard Cost, and Current or Replacement Cost.

Ž1989. used 1980 data and the results in this study will provide some basis for
comparative analyses.9 Second, most LIFO adoptions had been made by 1981 and
the rate of overall inflation had diminished by 1981. The financial variables are
measured for each firm as the average of the year-end values for 1977 through to
1980.10 Two sets of results are reported. In the first set, all relevant variables for
LIFO firms are appropriately adjusted and restated on a FIFO basis ŽWhite et al.,

1994, pp. 344–349.. In the second set, the reported numbers without adjustments
are used to provide a benchmark for purposes of comparison.
3.2.1. InÕestment opportunity set (IOS)
Following Myers Ž1977., firms are viewed as a combination of assets-in-place
and future investment or growth options. Firms with growth options are those
whose values depend on further discretionary expenditures by managers. These
include capacity expansion projects, new product introductions, acquisitions of
other firms and maintenance and replacement of existing assets ŽMason and
Merton, 1985; Gaver and Gaver, 1993.. Growth opportunities are captured in
terms of the IOS available to a firm. These IOS are expected to vary cross-sectionally since firms have different specific investments in physical and human assets
ŽSmith and Watts, 1992..
In this study, the IOS for each firm which is measured in terms of the notion of
assets-in-place versus growth opportunities as identified by Myers Ž1977. is
evaluated in terms of five proxies selected on the basis of prior studies ŽSkinner,
1993; Gaver and Gaver, 1993; Baber et al., 1996.. They are the ratio of the market
value of assets to the book value of assets, the ratio of the market value of the
equity to the book value of the equity ŽGaver and Gaver, 1993., the ratio of plant,
properties and equipment to the market value of the firm ŽSkinner, 1993., the ratio
of total research and development expenditure to total assets ŽSkinner, 1993. and
the geometric mean annual growth rate of market value of assets ŽBaber et al.,
1996..

on all the observations are reported in Tables 2 and 3. Panel A of Table 3 reports
the communalities11 of the five proxies and Panel B shows the eigenvalues.12 The
correlations between the common factor and the five proxies are reported in Panel
C. The correlations are all significant and in the predicted direction. Panel D
provides the descriptive statistics for the common factor.
The summary statistics in Table 2 indicate that the correlations between the
proxy variables are as expected ŽSkinner, 1993; Gaver and Gaver, 1993.. The
MKTBKAS, MKTBKEQ, RDA and MVAGR are all significantly correlated with
each other and highly significant. PPE is negatively correlated with each of the
other proxies and is also highly significant. Factor analysis is shown in Table 3.
As expected, the common factor is positively associated with MKTBKAS, MKTBKEQ, RDA and MVAGR and negatively correlated with PPE. All correlations
are statistically significant. The common factor analysis results indicate that one
factor fully explains the intercorrelations among the individual measures.13
11

Communalities are the squared multiple correlations obtained by regressing each of the proxies
with the other two proxies.
12
Cattrell Ž1966. and Harman Ž1976. suggest that if the first eigenvalue exceeds the sum of the three
communalities, this one common factor explains the intercorrelations among the individual measures.

3.2.2. Free cash flow (FCF) and debt
It is difficult to measure FCF as defined by Jensen Ž1986. because all future
projects cannot be readily identified and information on future relevant discount
rates is also not available. Thus, attempts have been made to use proxies. In this
study, the measure suggested by Lehn and Poulsen Ž1989. and adopted by
Agrawal and Jayaraman Ž1994. is used. Lehn and Poulsen Ž1989. defines FCF as
the operating income before depreciation minus interest expense, taxes, preferred
dividend and common dividend. In order to make the FCF figures comparable, an
adjustment is made to operating income and tax of LIFO firms and restated on a
FIFO basis by taking into account changes in the LIFO reserve account ŽWhite et
al., 1994, p. 344.. Following Lang et al. Ž1991. and Agrawal and Jayaraman

Ž1994., FCF is scaled by the value of total assets for the end of the previous year.
As an additional test, FCF is also scaled by total net sales of the previous year.14
Several measures of debt have appeared in the literature and the measure adopted
in this study follows the definition used by Skinner Ž1993., which is book value of
long term debt divided by the book value of total assets.
3.2.3. Control Õariables
Based on prior inventory studies, several control variables are selected. Size is
measured in terms of the log of sales ŽCushing and LeClere, 1992.. In addition,
14

Lehn and Poulsen Ž1989. argues that the scaled variable will be more comparable across firms. See
Lang et al. Ž1991. for arguments against the use of equity values as the denominator.

486

there are a number of other variables which may impact the choice of accounting
methods.15 Of these, a control variable adopted in this study but not in the Niehaus
Ž1989. study is the current ratio since Wilson and Christensen Ž1985. suggests that
lower ŽLIFO. balance sheet values for inventory could affect compliance with debt
covenants. Other control variables included are inventory materiality ŽCushing and
LeClere, 1992., return on assets ŽSkinner, 1993. and tax loss carryforwards
ŽCushing and LeClere, 1992.. All inventory values for the LIFO firms were
adjusted to an Aas-ifB FIFO basis. To control for the tax effect, a variable AINFLB
that measures the direction and rate of price changes is included in the regressions.
For this purpose, the information provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Producers’ Price Index is used to provide inflation factors that measure the
direction and rate of price change of the firms’ industries.
3.2.4. DescriptiÕe statistics
Descriptive statistics for FIFO and LIFO firms on debt, FCF, size, current ratio,
ROA, inventory materiality, tax loss carryforwards and the inflation factor are
provided in Panels A and C of Table 4. Panel A reports descriptive statistics for
the low growth firms Ž N s 74.16 with the LIFO adjustments while Panel C reports
the same statistics but without the LIFO adjustments. Panels B and D of Table 4
are similar except that descriptive statistics are for the whole sample of firms for
which complete observations are available.17
For low growth firms Žafter adjusting for LIFO., the differences are significant
for five of the variables. The results show that FIFO firms are smaller, are more
highly leveraged and have lower ROA. These results are expected and consistent
with prior studies ŽDopuch and Pincus, 1988; Cushing and LeClere, 1992;
Skinner, 1993.. The current ratio and the tax loss carryforwards are not significant
but are in the expected direction. Inventory materiality is not in the predicted
direction since it is higher for FIFO firms. This is, however, consistent with the
findings of Dopuch and Pincus Ž1988. and Cushing and LeClere Ž1992.. The
results for size may either be interpreted in terms of the political costs hypothesis
or the hypothesis that size is a proxy for bookkeeping costs and that larger firms
15

Management ownership ŽNiehaus, 1989. was not included in the regression for the reasons cited in
Cushing and LeClere Ž1992, footnote 8.. In addition, the focus of study is on low growth firms which
are generally large companies and have relatively low levels of management ownership ŽDemsetz and
Lehn, 1985.. It was also decided not to make additional investment in collecting compensation data
since prior results found little evidence of a link between compensation and choice of LIFOrFIFO
ŽHunt, 1985; Abdel-khalik, 1985; Dopuch and Pincus, 1988..
16
For convenience, the descriptive statistics reported are for 74 firms which are used in the overall
regression equations. The descriptive statistics are not qualitatively different when the sample sizes are
different which arise since there were less missing values for some of the variables such as the debt
ratio.
17
Panels A and C exclude IOS Žfactor. scores since the sample represents firms with the bottom
quartile of IOS Žfactor. scores.

F.A. Gul r Journal of Corporate Finance 7 (2001) 475–492

487

can absorb these costs more readily ŽCushing and LeClere, 1992.. Both the debt
and current ratio results are consistent with the debt covenant hypothesis. Firms
with higher leverage prefer FIFO and firms with low current ratios also prefer
FIFO which improves their current ratio. FCF is significantly lower for FIFO firms
and this is not in the predicted direction. It is possible that this is because FIFO
firms are smaller and therefore have lower FCF.18 As expected, LIFO firms are
associated with higher inflationary levels. On the whole, these results are similar
to those reported in prior studies ŽDopuch and Pincus, 1988; Cushing and LeClere,
1992; Skinner, 1993.. Panel C which reports the descriptive statistics for the
unadjusted figures shows that there are some differences. Debt becomes insignificant and the sign for the current ratio changes to the wrong direction. Inventory
materiality also becomes more significant in the wrong direction. As suggested by
Dopuch and Pincus Ž1988., these results could be artifacts of the choice of
inventory methods adopted. Panels B and D which report similar figures for the
whole sample Žafter screening for IOS and other missing values. show that
generally the results are similar. In particular, LIFO firms are associated with
higher levels of inflation and lower levels of IOS. These results are consistent with
Skinner’s Ž1993. study and provide support for the tax benefit hypothesis.

4. Results and discussion
Logistic regressions for low growth firms are run to evaluate the effects of the
independent variables on firms’ choice of inventory method. The dependent
variable is coded 1 if FIFO is chosen and 0 if LIFO is chosen. A positive
coefficient indicates a higher likelihood of selecting an income increasing method
ŽFIFO. while a negative coefficient indicates a lower Žhigher. likelihood of
selecting FIFO ŽLIFO.. To test the debtrFCF interaction term, the following basic
logistic regression model is formulated:
Y s a q b 1 FCF q b 2 debt q b 3 FCF)debt
where Y is the likelihood that managers choose FIFO.
The b 3 parameter measures the extent to which the association between FCF
and inventory choice is affected by debt and is expected to be negative. Tests are
conducted by adding control variables to this basic model.
Table 5 reports the results for the various equations. The table also provides the
Wald chi-square and the level of significance for each estimated coefficient, the
overall regression p-value and the R-squares.
18

Jensen Ž1986. argues that FCF is a problem that is more likely to be associated with large firms
than smaller firms.

Panel A reports the logistic regressions for the Aas ifB adjusted figures. The
estimate for the size19 variable is reliably negative and this is also consistent with
expectations ŽCushing and LeClere, 1992.. Apart from the usual political costs
hypothesis, Biddle Ž1989. and Morse and Richardson Ž1983. found that firms
switched to LIFO after their estimated tax savings reached a high plateau. This is
consistent with the fixed level of costs of switching. Such costs would be more
easily absorbed by large firms which would also have a higher probability of
reaching a critical plateau in any one year. The current ratio is negative and
consistent with expectations and the findings by Cushing and LeClere Ž1992..
ROA is reliably negative suggesting that firms with high profitability choose
LIFO, a result which is consistent with Skinner Ž1993.. The estimate for inventory
materiality is negative when FCF is scaled by net sales but not when FCF is scaled
by total assets. The negative sign is consistent with predictions that firms with
large inventory are less likely to use FIFO and take advantage of the tax benefits
of LIFO. The positive sign results are consistent with Cushing and LeClere Ž1992.

direction Žp. 361.. The sign for the inflation factor is not significant but in the
expected direction in Model 1 but not in Model 2 of Panel A.20 More importantly,
Panel A shows that the interaction between FCF and debt is reliably negative and
suggests that the positive relationship between FCF and FIFO weakens at progres-

Other measures of size such as log of assets and actual sales produced similar results.
This result is due to the fact that the sample only focussed on low growth firms since when a

sively higher levels of debt. The results support Jensen’s FCF and debt monitoring
hypothesis.
As a benchmark, logistic regression results using the unadjusted reported
numbers are also reported in Panel B. The results are insignificant for most of the
variables including the interaction term. This suggests that the adjusted numbers
were more effective in capturing the suggested theoretical relationships. As a
AcontrolB sample, results for the high growth subsample Ž N s 70. are also
reported in Panels C and D both in terms of the adjusted and unadjusted figures.21
The results are insignificant in most cases and provide further evidence in support
of the hypothesis.

5. Summary and conclusion
This study provides evidence to show that managers of low growthrhigh FCF
firms with high debt are more likely to act in the interest of shareholders and
therefore less Žmore. likely to choose FIFO ŽLIFO.. Overall, these results increase
our understanding of the determinants of accounting policy choice and add to the
literature on finance theory in two ways. First, and most importantly, it is the first
study to demonstrate the role of FCF and debt as a monitoring device in managers’
choice of inventory accounting method. Future research should examine the role of
FCF and debt in other accounting methods choice. Second, the study provides
some support for a stream of literature on the tax benefits hypothesis for the
choice of LIFOrFIFO.
