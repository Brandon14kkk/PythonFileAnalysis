Abstract
This article empirically tests the hypothesis that credit-screening standards can be first increasing and
then decreasing in the quality of the bank’s pool of potential borrowers, which in turn may vary through
the business cycle or across different segments of the lending markets. A key implication is that banks with
lending opportunities toward the middle of the quality spectrum can have loan portfolios that perform better
than do the portfolios of banks with loan-origination opportunities that are either too weak or too strong.
Using banks’ volume of secondary-market loan sales as a proxy for the richness of lending opportunities,
I find an inverse U-shaped relation between the performance of banks’ loan portfolios and their activity in
the loan sales market. The pattern deserves scrutiny for its policy implications, as many regulators hold the
view that countercyclical variation in credit standards may have a destabilizing effect on business cycles.

1. Introduction
Mainstream theories on banking commonly attribute the existence of intermediaries to their
efficiency in the credit-screening and monitoring of borrowers (e.g., Diamond, 1984; Campbell
and Kracaw, 1980; Boyd and Prescott, 1986). For policymakers and regulators, the effect of
credit standards on loan availability and economic output is material—so much so that the Fed
administers periodic surveys that measure the change in credit standards by studying the qualitative
answers of loan officers. For instance, a study of a Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank Lending

by Lown et al. (2006) suggests that a tightening of credit standards explains a significant portion
of the subsequent decline in business lending and wholesale inventory investment.1
This paper analyzes empirically how the stringency of bank credit-screening standards depends
on the exogenous quality of the bank’s pool of potential borrowers, which may vary with the
business cycle or across different segments of the lending markets (e.g. different industries or
geographical regions). In a theoretical framework, Ruckes (2004) develops the hypothesis that
banks choose stricter standards of screening when the quality of the borrower pool is toward the
middle of the quality spectrum than when the quality is either too low or too high. The intuition is
simple: when the marginal benefits of screening out bad projects exceed the marginal costs of credit
verification, the bank will adopt high lending standards (i.e., evaluate applicants more carefully
and lend more often to good types). This result holds when the probability that screening the
borrower will reveal a good type is sufficiently – but not too – high. In contrast, bank’s incentives
to screen are the lowest if the probability of discovering a high type is close to zero (e.g., severe
recessions, or small regional banks) or one (e.g., economic booms, or large money-center banks).
Consistently, the empirical tests of this article reveal a pattern that would not seem obvious had
one not considered the variation in credit standards: Bank loan-portfolio performance can be first
increasing and then decreasing in the richness of the bank’s loan-origination opportunities.
The intuition behind the inverse U-shaped relation analyzed in this paper is also close in spirit
to the strand of literature (e.g., Diamond, 1991; Berlin and Loeys, 1988; Hoshi et al., 1993;
Rajan, 1992) that analyzes when it is optimal for borrowers to choose bank loan (debt with bank
monitoring) over public debt (arm’s-length debt with no monitoring). A central result of these
papers is that the firm’s choice between debt with or without monitoring depends on the firm’s
credit rating (i.e., the probability that the firm is a high type). Borrowers with too low a credit
rating choose public debt—if they can obtain debt financing at all. Those borrowers with too high
a credit rating choose public debt over bank loans (except in Rajan’s model where the high type
is indifferent between the two sources of finance). The managers of highly rated firms do not
need bank monitoring to commit to exerting a high level of effort (i.e., choosing the good project)
because of their reputation capital at stake. At the same time, from the bank’s point of view, the
benefits of monitoring or of pre-issue screening high-quality firms does not justify the costs of
doing so. For the intermediate-quality firms, however, the costs of monitoring or pre-screening
are less than the benefits of committing the firm to undertake efficient projects, or the benefits of
screening out the low types. In equilibrium, therefore, only firms with intermediate credit ratings
rely on debt with monitoring. Like these models, the model tested here is also based on the idea
that borrower quality should be associated with the level of bank screening. Different from them
however, this paper’s setting ignores the choice of the firm and focuses on the bank’s actions only.
The empirical tests of this paper draw heavily on the observation that lending markets can
be segmented; for instance, banks in different localities can have differential access to potential borrowers (e.g., Pennacchi, 1988; Carlstrom and Samolyk, 1995). As a result, banks whose
loan-origination opportunities exceed their funding capacities (e.g. money center banks with constrained capital) originate more loans than they can profitably keep on their books and sell2 the
1 The impact of credit availability on the economy (and vice versa) is a classic question among macroeconomists. See,
for instance, Gorton and Winton (2003).
2 Note that the reference is to the secondary loan sales, which differ from loan syndications (see Gorton and Haubrich,
1990, for a description of the secondary loan sales market). In a secondary sale, the bank first originates and funds the
loan, and then participates it (or a proportion thereof) to another institution. In a syndicated loan deal, before originating
the loan, the lead manager (or a group of them) arranges a group of participants that will fund portions of the loan. All

excess to other domestic and foreign banks, as well as to nonbank financial institutions such as
money-market funds. Thus, the “comparative-advantage” hypothesis, which formally develops
these arguments, predicts a positive correlation between loan sales and lending opportunities. The
key feature of the analysis here, then, is to use loan sales activity at the bank level as a proxy for
the bank’s lending opportunities (with certain caveats to be discussed shortly).
To test the model’s implications for loan-portfolio quality, I analyze a large sample of quarterly
reports of condition and income (bank call reports) compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Supportive of the hypothesis, I find that balance-sheet measures of
nonperforming loans are first decreasing, and then increasing in the level of loan sales.
For additional tests, I obtained a sample of loans from the Loan Pricing Corporation’s Dealscan,
and then hand-matched the Dealscan lender names to the FDIC call reports and the borrower names
to CRSP and COMPUSTAT. Because data on loan performance are not available, I examine
borrower risk instead. To quantify it, I reason as follows. The costly credit-screening technology
of banks is valuable only if it produces soft information about firm prospects beyond what the
publicly observed information on the borrower can indicate. Soft information, in turn, should
help the bank predict future borrower performance. My analysis thus proxies for borrower quality
with several measures of post-issue borrower performance such as stock returns, return on assets,
interest coverage, and distance to default. Overall, the results of the borrower-level analysis
confirm those of the bank-level analysis: There is a nonmonotonic relation between post-issue
borrower performance and the originating bank’s loan-sales volume.
Finally, a couple of caveats about the interpretation of results are in order. First, comparative
advantage is not the only driver of loan sales.3 For instance, other (perhaps complementary)
hypotheses assert that loan sales might provide a mechanism for portfolio rebalancing to shift
asset risk, or for underwriting securities without violating the regulations that prohibit banks
from the practice.4 To the extent that other motivations for loan sales do not lead directly to
the origination of poor quality loans, the implication is a noisier proxy and a bias toward the
documented results. If, however, banks originate poorer quality loans with the intention of sale
(moral hazard) or pick the lower quality loans already on their balance sheets for sale (adverse
selection),5 and if Dealscan loans are more representative of sold loans rather than all loans
originated by active sellers, the interpretation of the empirical results involving the Dealscan
loans will be less clear. Namely, the poor quality of loans might be due to loan sales itself rather
than the variable it is intended to proxy for.6 The weight of evidence in this article – at least

lenders in the syndicate then fund the loan simultaneously. The lead bank(s) or the participant(s) can still sell their shares
of the loan in the secondary market, which is in fact a common practice (see Demsetz, 1993).
3 Although the comparative advantage hypothesis is not the only explanation for loan sales, it is the one that finds the
most support in the literature. See, for instance, Demsetz (1993, 2000), and Haubrich and Thomson (1996) for empirical
evidence. Stylized facts also support the hypothesis. A handful of money-center banks with access to many potential
borrowers through their network of branches located throughout the financial centers of the world generated most of the
loan sales during the 1980s and early 1990s, whereas loan buyers mainly comprised small regional banks, foreign banks,
and nonbank financial institutions (see Gorton and Haubrich, 1990, for details on the features of the loan sales market).
4 See Berger and Udell (1993) for a comprehensive discussion of these and other hypotheses on loan sales.
5 Dahiya et al. (2003) find evidence consistent with this interpretation; stock price of companies whose loans are sold
react negatively to the sale announcement.
6 At the time of this writing, for instance, banks and other investors in the US are reporting losses from mortgages
extended to the relatively less creditworthy consumers in the housing market (“subprime crisis”). It is hard to argue that
the low quality loans were made as a response to improving lending opportunities rather than to satisfy increased investor
demand due to a technological shock that allowed easy securitization of low quality loans.

indirectly – is more in favor of the former hypothesis. As demonstrated here as well as in Güner
(2006), interest spreads for loans originated by most active sellers are on average lower than those
originated by banks that are less active sellers – controlling for an array of bank variables and
contractual features, as well as proxies for observable and unobservable borrower quality. This
is inconsistent with the moral hazard explanation being a first order effect driving the portfolio
quality results of this paper. Furthermore, the documented loan-quality effects at the borrower
level hold only among the sole-lender loans, a small portion of which is intended for resale, as
opposed to the syndicated loans sample, which is in fact the primary source of loans sold in this
sample period. Yet, without a comprehensive dataset of retained and sold loans, such as the one
marketed by the Loan Pricing Corporation after the completion of this research, it is difficult to
rule out with confidence the moral hazard hypothesis using data at the loan level.
Second caveat is about the sample period of this paper, which covers 1984–1993 due to the
availability of the loan sales variable in the regulatory bank filings. One may be concerned that the
motivation and the mechanics of loan sales as well as the segmented nature of the lending markets
have evolved substantially since 1993, thus rendering the conclusions of this study irrelevant.
These concerns, however valid as they may be, speak more to the validity of loan sales as an
empirical proxy for lending opportunities in more recent periods, rather than the more general
relevance of the question studied. To the extent that economic prospects of banks continue to vary
across time (business cycles), or across market segments (industries or regions), countercyclical
variation in credit standards may continue to be a relevant pattern for economists, regulators,
bankers, and CFOs alike.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the hypotheses. Section 3
presents the empirical tests using bank-level data from the FDIC call reports. Section 4 extends
the empirical analysis by examining the data at the borrower level using a hand-matched dataset
of Dealscan loans. Section 5 offers concluding comments.
2. Hypotheses
Ruckes (2004) sets up a rigorous model of bank lending with asymmetric information taking
into account lender competition, loan pricing, and credit screening intensity. Here, I give a very
high level summary of the model’s implications for credit standards, in order to convey the
intuition behind the hypotheses tested. The object of this paper is not to formally test the highly
structured Ruckes model; rather, I present it as a source of motivation for the hypothesis that credit
screening standards and bank portfolio quality can be nonmonotonic in the quality of a bank’s
loan pool.
In the economy, there are two types of borrowers, good and bad, which differ in the expected
success rate for the projects undertaken. The good type yields a payoff of X; the bad one yields
zero. The a priori and exogeneous probability that a loan applicant is of the good type, λ (0,
1), is known to the bank before any action is taken. Issues related to the borrower’s self-selection
are assumed away as λ is assumed to be exogeneous. Parameters are such that the bank would
never lend to the bad type in a perfect information world, and would always lend to the good
type. The bank possesses a costly screening technology, which yields a signal that reveals the
borrower type perfectly with probability q, and a non-informative signal with probability 1 − q.
Cost of screening is increasing in q. The bank first decides the intensity of screening, q, and
upon observing the signal (s = G, s = B, or s = 0), decides whether to extend the loan or reject the
applicant. As mentioned, if s = G or s = B, the strategy is simply to accept or to reject, respectively.
When s = 0 is observed, lenders play mixed strategies, by extending a “risky” loan with probability

μ. A key result is that there is an equilibrium where credit-screening intensity (q) is first increasing
in λ up to a threshold, λ*, and then decreasing past this threshold.7
The model tells a stylized story of the following sort. If lending opportunities are relatively poor
(λ is low), as in recessions, lenders never extend a risky loan (μ). A low q combined with zero μ
is essentially credit rationing. In the cross section, one can think of low λ corresponding to small
regional banks located in regions with poor loan origination opportunities. As economic prospects
improve, credit standards (q) increase while banks also start extending some risky loans. Going
from the middle of the λ spectrum to the high end, credit screening intensity q starts decreasing
while risky loan volume μ is increasing. With increasing λ, the portfolio quality would reflect a
combination of the fewer safe loans (low q) and many but decreasingly risky loans (high μ with
an increasing probability λ of payback). Low q and high μ imply a worsening portfolio quality,
while increasing λ implies an improving portfolio quality. The net effect is thus the object of the
empirical tests.
Hypothesis 1a. Since credit screening intensity q starts to decrease at relatively high levels of λ
(when λ > λ*), loan portfolio quality of banks with very good lending opportunities can be lower
than that of banks with inferior lending opportunities.
Note that, when taken literally, the model implies that banks with poor lending opportunities
with λ < λ* never extend risky loans, which in fact depends critically on the assumption that bank
funding costs (δ) are constant across banks (λ* is essentially a multiplier of δ and hence increasing
in the interest rate at which the bank raises its funds). Because small regional banks typically have
a larger proportion of their liabilities in cheaply obtained deposits, they tend to have a funding cost
advantage compared with larger banks, which fund most of their liabilities with money-market
instruments at the competitive rate. If we instead allow banks to face increasing marginal costs,
as in the comparative advantage model of Pennacchi (1988), small banks (those with low λ and
low δ) would also end up extending some risky loans, rendering the empirical implications of
the model at low λ region less precise than those presented in the paper. Thus, at low levels of
λ, with increasing λ, portfolio quality would reflect a combination of few but safe loans (low q),
and also few but very risky loans (combined with low μ and a probability λ of payback). The
number of those risky loans (μ) is higher for banks with lower financing costs (δ), which is an
unmodeled aspect of the lending market in this setting.8 At low levels of λ, therefore, as in the
other extreme, whether portfolios of banks with low λ are riskier than those with higher λ is an
empirical question.
Hypothesis 1b. If low levels of λ are accompanied by low funding costs, portfolio quality will
more closely reflect the low quality of the lending pool faced by the bank. Hence, at relatively low
levels of λ (when λ < λ*), portfolio quality should be increasing in λ. Alternatively, if funding cost
δ is more homogenous in this region, banks will extend only safe loans all the time and portfolio
quality will be the same across banks, as implied by the original setting of the model.
7 As credit screening technology is becoming less costly due to improving technologies such as credit scoring or
improved firm disclosure, we would conjecture to observe more credit screening as screening becomes profitable for
lower ␭ and the threshold beyond which relaxing the standard is optimal due to screening cost becomes increasingly
higher. At one extreme discontinuity, for instance, in a world with zero credit screening costs (borne by the banks at least),
there would be no variation in lending standards as a function of the loan pool. In such a world, however, the existence of
commercial banks as traditional lenders would also be in question.
8 Note that Ruckes (2004) actually analyzes the effect of introducing deposit insurance, which is essentially closely
related to the variation in ␦. However, his setting does not incorporate heterogeneity across banks.

Besides this level effect in portfolio quality across all banks, I will also hypothesize a nonmonotonic dispersion effect in λ. Namely, because banks with high credit standards screen more
intensely and lend more often to the high type regardless of the exact value of λ, we should observe
a wider dispersion of portfolio quality when credit standards start decreasing due to very high λ.
Hypothesis 2a. At relatively high levels of λ, cross-sectional variation in observed portfolio
quality should be increasing in λ.
Again, analogously to the level effect of Hypothesis 1b, observing the dispersion effect not
only at the high end but also at the low end of the λ spectrum requires existence of banks with
low funding costs (δ) that extend a positive number of risky loans.
Hypothesis 2b. If low levels of λ are accompanied by low funding costs, at relatively low levels
of λ, cross-sectional variation in observed portfolio quality can be decreasing in λ. Alternatively, if
funding cost δ is more homogenous in this region, banks will extend only safe loans and dispersion
of portfolio quality will be the same across banks, as implied by the original setting of the
model.
Finally, for a further test of the credit-standards hypothesis, I shift the gears a bit and consider
its implication for loan pricing rather than loan quality. If the bank expends more effort (high q)
to discover the borrower type, the loan decision is more likely to be an informed one. Hence the
loan price is more likely to vary as a function of the revealed true borrower type.
Hypothesis 3. If the bank follows stricter lending standards, loan pricing should be more correlated with “soft” information on the borrower (i.e., borrower quality observed by the bank, but
not by the public at the time of lending).
Empirically, I shall control for publicly observable borrower characteristics and test whether
future borrower performance (i.e., distance to default) is related to loan pricing in each bank
category. The intuition is that soft information helps predict borrower future, which in turn is
likely to affect loan price—if the bank screens and learns the borrower type.
3. Hypothesis tests at the bank level
As a proxy for the quality of lending opportunities λ, which itself is not directly observable,
I shall use the bank’s relative volume of loan sales. As noted by Gorton and Haubrich (1990),
the stylized facts about loan sales in the sample period show three distinct categories of banks
in terms of their relative activity in the secondary loan sales market: (1) nonsellers (low λ), (2)
moderate sellers (moderate λ), and (3) active sellers (high λ). Active sellers differ from moderate
sellers by a notable jump in loan-sales volume. For instance, the most active five sellers from
1984 to 1993 accounted for approximately 61% of the total loan-sales volume.
3.1. Data
I obtained bank balance-sheet data from the FDIC’s quarterly call reports database. Using only
those institutions that are defined as commercial banks (with entity code 10) results in a sample
of approximately 450,000 bank-quarter observations. My sample period is limited to 1984–1993,
since the regulation change in 1993 ended the requirement to report the amount of commercial and
industrial (C&I) loans originated and sold by the bank. Although the definition of the loan-sales
variable in call reports does not explicitly say the variable includes C&I loans only, earlier studies

68

A.B. Güner / Journal of Financial Stability 4 (2008) 62–87

commonly interpret the variable as such.9 If a loan is not sold entirely, which is a common case,
the variable records only the sold portion of the loan. In particular, it excludes the portion of
the loan that is syndicated to the participants by the lead manager. Thus, the variable tracks loan
participations (or secondary-market loan sales) only.
To measure the bank’s relative loan-sales activity, I use the total amount of C&I loans originated
and sold by the bank, scaled by the level of C&I loans on the balance sheet (“SALES”).10
Sorting bank-quarter observations into SALES deciles,11 I provide summary statistics in Table 1.
Approximately 60% of the observations are from nonseller bank-quarters. Within sellers, the bulk
of the sales volume (79%) was generated by banks in the top SALES vintile (denoted by column
10B in Table 1). Moreover, bank size tends to be increasing in loan sales. Even though these
observations have been reported elsewhere (e.g., Gorton and Haubrich, 1990; Berger and Udell,
1993), a new pattern concerning the bad-loans ratio emerges. As the last two rows of the table
demonstrate, both measures of the bad-loans ratio (non-accrual and 90-day-past-due C&I loans
as a ratio of the C&I loans outstanding) are lower among moderate sellers than they are among
nonsellers. Moving to the most active sellers (vintile 10B), however, both ratios demonstrate an
increase, which is consistent with the hypothesis that portfolio quality can be nonmonotonic in
lending opportunities (proxied by loan sales).
3.2. Cross-sectional analysis
To gauge the statistical significance of the nonmonotonic pattern observed in the summary
statistics, I employ OLS regressions where the dependent variable is the bad-loans ratio (NONPERFORM), constructed as the non-accrual plus 90-day-past-due C&I loans scaled by the size
of C&I loans outstanding. Since bank assets are highly skewed in the sample period, for an easier
interpretation of results, I perform the analysis separately in subsamples split by bank size according to the following cutoffs: $100 million, $500 million, and $1 billion. The explanatory variables
are indicators for SALES deciles (SALES X), constructed by sorting observations separately in
each size subsample by SALES. ACTIVE is a dummy that is equal to 1 if SALES is in the top
decile, and SELLER is a dummy that is equal to 1 if SALES is greater than 0. For further controls,
I include the logarithm of bank total assets, equity-to-assets ratio (as a proxy for overall financial
health), and indicators for years.
The results in Table 2A demonstrate the nonmonotonic relation between portfolio quality and
loan sales. NONPERFORM drops between nonsellers and sellers as the SELLER dummy has
a coefficient estimate that is negative and statistically significant. Portfolio quality is roughly
the same among sellers, except for those in the top SALES decile. The coefficient estimate for

9 See item number 3431 in the dictionary files available from the Chicago Federal Reserve’s web site at:
http://www.chicagofed.org/economic research and data/data/commercial bank dictionary.cfm. The item excludes certain sales like consumer loans, residential mortgages and federal funds. While the loan sales variable may also include
commercial real estate loans, to be consistent with the latter part of this study where I use a sample of corporate loans, I
analyze commercial and industrial loans only and employ the variable as a proxy for C&I loans sold. This interpretation
is consistent with previous studies that use the variable in a similar fashion; see, for instance, Demsetz (2000), Berger and
Udell (1993), and Cantor and Demsetz (1993). My conversations with call report analysts at the FDIC also confirmed this
interpretation. Overall, the added noise would only bias my tests against finding the documented results.
10 Since this construction leaves us with a flow measure in the numerator and a stock measure in the denominator, a
value of greater than one is possible and in fact observed in the data.
11 Note that sorting within each year does not change the results.

Summary statistics for commercial banks (entity type code 10) according to the call reports they filed from 1984 to 1993. The amount of loans purchased becomes available in
the 4th quarter of 1987. SALES denotes the amount of loans sold in a quarter divided by the end-of-quarter C&I loans outstanding on the bank balance sheet. PURCHASE is
computed similarly for loans purchased in a given quarter. The whole sample is then sorted into SALES deciles. SALES is equal to 0 for 61.6% of observations. Decile 10 is
further split into vintiles, denoted as 10A and 10B.

ACTIVE is positive and statistically significant, suggesting a fall in portfolio quality for the most
active sellers. Overall, these findings are consistent with Hypothesis 1.
To test the dispersion effect of Hypothesis 2, I construct a measure of cross-sectional variation
in portfolio quality in each SALES decile as follows:
DEV = |NONPERFORM − E[NONPERFORM]|
In this equation, E[NONPERFORM] is the sample average of NONPERFORM in a given bank
size and SALES-decile subsample. DEV is then the absolute value of the deviation of the badloans ratio from the sample mean. I regress DEV on the same set of variables as before and present
the results in Table 2B. As the negative (positive) coefficient estimate on SELLER (ACTIVE)
suggests, the cross-sectional variation in loan portfolio quality is lower among moderate sellers
than it is among nonsellers and active sellers. Indicators for other SALES deciles are mostly
zero, statistically and economically. The findings therefore seem consistent with Hypothesis 2.
Put differently, portfolio quality is cross sectionally more uniform among moderate sellers than
it is among nonsellers and active sellers.
3.3. Time series analysis
For further tests of Hypothesis 1, I turn to time-series tests that exploit the temporal variation
in loan-sales volume within banks. Namely, I explore portfolio quality when there are shocks to
a bank’s lending opportunity set.
If loan sales occur as a bank acquires comparative advantage in lending opportunities (e.g.,
Pennacchi, 1988; Carlstrom and Samolyk, 1995), we should see an improvement in portfolio
quality before the first loan sale. I thus examine banks that were initially nonsellers for at least
3 consecutive years during the sample period, before recording a loan sale for the first time; this
filter yields 4710 bank-year observations.
Fig. 1 plots the inverse portfolio quality (NONPERFORM) in event time, where t denotes the
year in which the first loan sale is recorded, t − 1 denotes the preceding year, etc. Yearly means and
medians of NONPERFORM are both decreasing in time, confirming the comparative advantage
hypothesis of loan sales—thus supporting the choice of loan sales as a proxy for loan-origination
opportunities.

Fig. 1. Loan portfolio quality as a bank becomes a first-time seller. This figure illustrates the change in balance-sheet
quality for commercial banks that start selling loans in year t. The sample contains only those banks that have sold no
loans for at least three consecutive years included, which yields a sample size of 4710 bank-year observations. Bad-loans
ratio is the sum of nonaccrual and 90-day-past-due C&I loans scaled by the total C&I loans outstanding on the balance
sheet. A higher ratio denotes a lower quality balance sheet.

loan sales generated by the most active five sellers in the sample period: Security Pacific, Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank,

Fig. 3. Loan portfolio quality of the most active five sellers. This figure illustrates the quarterly change in the average
balance-sheet quality of the top five loan sellers, net of the average portfolio quality of nonsellers that have book assets
over $1 billion. Bad-loans ratio is the sum of nonaccrual and 90-day-past-due C&I loans scaled by the total C&I loans
outstanding. SALES ratio denotes the quarterly average of SALES for the five loan sellers, where SALES is the amount
of loans sold in a given quarter divided by the C&I loans outstanding.

To examine shocks to lending opportunities when the quality of the borrower pool (λ) is already
high, I turn to the five most active sellers during my sample period. These banks together accounted
for 61% of the total sales volume (Security Pacific, 24.8%; Citibank, 12.6%; Bankers Trust, 12.4%;
Chemical Bank, 6.3%; and Chase Manhattan, 5.4%). Fig. 2 demonstrates a significant variation
in these banks’ volume of loan sales – an initial hike in 1987 followed by a significant drop after
1990 – providing us with a setting for a natural experiment where lending opportunities seem to
have varied due to exogenous changes in economic conditions. Demsetz (1993) explains that this
pattern stems from an initial increase in saleable loans (i.e., loans for financing M&A activities
of firms), and a subsequent drop in their supply, coinciding with the turn of the business cycle.
In Fig. 3, I plot the average bad-loans ratio12 (NONPERFORM) of these five banks juxtaposed
to their average SALES ratio. Interestingly, the initial hike in SALES around 1987 is accompanied
by a parallel jump in NONPERFORM, just as the drop in SALES in 1990 concurs with a drop
12 To control for macro trends in the level of non-performing loans, I subtract from the average bad-loans ratio of these
five banks the quarterly average bad-loans indicator for all nonseller banks with assets greater than $1 billion.

74

in NONPERFORM. It seems that, as lending opportunities become richer, suggested by the
increased loan sales, banks relax their credit standards resulting in a lower performance of their
portfolios. As lending opportunities stat to get weaker – which coincides with the recession of
1990 – observed portfolio quality improves.
4. Hypothesis tests at the borrower level
The results of the bank-level analysis seem consistent with the model’s implications,
Hypotheses 1 and 2. Yet, a difficulty with interpreting the findings of Section 3 is that balancesheet variables indicate loan performance only for those loans that are retained on the books. If
loans kept on the balance sheet systematically differ from those that are sold, then the loan-sales
variable will not be an unbiased proxy for the quality of originated loans across banks, and thus for
the variation in the lending opportunity set. This selection bias might be in either direction. If there
are adverse selection issues with loan sales, then sold loans will tend to be riskier than retained
loans. Since selling the lemons implies safer balance sheets for active sellers, however, this effect
cannot explain my results. Alternatively, however, safe loans may be easier to sell, or selling safe
loans may help the bank increase the expected returns on equity by increasing asset risk (James,
1988). If these effects are significant, then active sellers may have riskier balance sheets than
do moderate sellers, even if the former group originates safer loans than does the latter. A more
powerful test, therefore, should examine the quality of all loans originated by the bank—both
sold and retained. In addition, data on loan contracts will also allow a test of Hypothesis 3, which
requires data on borrowers and loan prices.
As noted in the introduction, an important assumption here is that Dealscan loans are representative of both sold and retained loans in general. While this might be true for sole-lender
loans, we know that most of the syndicated loans are frequently sold in the secondary market
(Demsetz, 1993). Primarily for this reason, I excluded syndicated loans from my analysis and
focused on sole-lenders only. Given that I also tested for and found none of the nonmonotonicity
effects among syndicated loans, however, suggests that moral hazard problem due to loan sales
is unlikely to be the main driver of the results.13
4.1. Data
I obtained a sample of corporate loans from the Loan Pricing Corporation’s Dealscan database.
As the Dealscan data start in 1987 and the FDIC loan sales variable ends in 1993, my sample
period is 1987–1993. Although Dealscan provides detailed information on contract features such
as pricing, maturity, deal size, seniority and security, it contains no information on lenders and
borrowers beyond their names. I thus hand-match the Dealscan lender names14 to the bank names

13 Besides the moral hazard bias, I also conjecture that syndicated loans would decrease the power of tests for the lending
opportunities hypothesis since they are typically viewed as close substitutes for public debt (e.g., Jones et al., 2005; Dennis
and Mullineaux, 2000). Borrowers in this category are predominantly large companies with credit ratings for which credit
screening have minimal benefits (e.g., Diamond, 1991).
14 In cases where Dealscan does not report the specific location of the lender, the Dealscan name might yield several
exact matches in the FDIC sample, since banks belonging to the same holding company are required to file call reports
by the state they are chartered in. Dropping these observations would cause considerable data loss, especially because
some of these banks are influential loan sellers such as Security Pacific, Bankers Trust, Bank of America, etc. I thus
consolidate the balance sheets of these banks. In most cases, each banking corporation has one main bank (usually the

A.B. Güner / Journal of Financial Stability 4 (2008) 62–87

75

in the FDIC database of call reports and the Dealscan borrower names15 to CRSP and COMPUSTAT. The initial download yields 4942 sole-lender loan facilities (and 7890 syndicated loans
which are excluded). The matching process yields approximately 1500 loan facilities or about
1000 distinct loan deals. (A loan deal may comprise a term loan and a revolving credit line which
are recorded as separate facilities.) Because Dealscan loans tend to be biased toward larger loans
extended by the larger lenders, it may not be representative of the whole population. Unfortunately, this data limitation is common to many studies in the literature that employ the Dealscan
database,16 and the reader is cautioned against the usual small sample bias.
Sorting loans into deciles by the lender’s SALES ratio17 (the total amount of C&I loans sold
during the year of lending scaled by the average volume of C&I loans outstanding), I provide
summary statistics on borrowers, banks and various contract features in Table 3. Active sellers
(i.e., those in the top SALES decile)18 have SALES ratios and total assets significantly higher
than do moderate sellers (i.e., loan sellers in all but the top SALES decile). The sample selection
tends to favor larger banks in comparison with the call-reports sample; only 8% of the loans are
extended by nonsellers in the loans sample, even though 60% of the quarter-bank observations in
the call-reports sample are nonsellers. This pattern is possibly due not only to the sample selection
of Dealscan, but also to my requirement that the borrower needs to be publicly traded.
4.2. Methodology
Here, I determine whether the nonmonotonic relation between loan portfolio quality and lending opportunities observed at the bank level also holds at the borrower level. I thus analyze how
borrower quality19 that can be discovered by banks only as a result of costly credit screening
varies with the lender’s quality of lending opportunities (proxied by the lender’s SALES ratio).
The assumption is that bank credit-screening produces soft information on firm prospects beyond
what the publicly observed data can indicate at the time of borrowing. Soft information, in turn,
should help predict future borrower performance. Consequently, I quantify borrower quality by
several measures of post-issue borrower performance: stock returns, return on assets, interest
coverage, and distance to default. The tests control for past borrower performance, and examine
post-issue borrower quality as a function of bank loan sales.
The first proxy for borrower quality is the buy-and-hold stock returns during the 12 months
after the lending. The after-event stock returns are likely to indicate whether borrower prospects
in general improve or worsen after the lending. As further indicators for borrower fundamentals,
one identified as the national association) that accounts for most of the firm’s assets and loans. For other cases, working
with the consolidated data would only bias the results against my findings, thus rendering the procedure innocuous for
my experiments.
15 I do a first order check on the borrower-name matching by comparing the firm SIC codes and asset sizes between
Dealscan and CRSP/COMPUSTAT.
16 Among many other studies that analyze Dealscan loans, for instance, see Hubbard et al. (2002), and Drucker and Puri
(2005) which uses a similar matching method between borrowers, lenders, and banks. Hubbard et al. report a similar hit
rate from the initial download to the final sample used.
17 Note that sorting within a year (instead of the whole sample) does not change the conclusion of the results. In addition,
using the loan-sales value for the quarter of lending, instead of the total value for the whole year, yields very similar
results.
18 For comparison to the earlier results, I verified that the 16 banks in the top SALES decile of the loans sample fall in
the top deciles of the large sample.
19 Ideally, I would like to analyze ex post loan performance. Due to the lack of these data, however, I instead analyze
ex-post borrower performance as a proxy for the loan quality.

The sample means or counts of variables for which data exist in the intersection of the FDIC Call Reports, CRSP, COMPUSTAT, and the Loan Pricing Corporation’s Dealscan.
The sample period is 1987–1993. SALES denotes the amount of loans sold in the year of lending divided by the average level of C&I loans outstanding on the bank balance
sheet. The whole sample of loan facilities is sorted into SALES deciles (0–10). SALES decile 1 starts at the 8th percentile, since loan sales below this percentile are zero. All
monetary values are given in USD millions. Borrower stock volatility and average stock returns are measured during the 12 months before the loan origination. Accounting
variables are the averages over the four quarters before the loan origination.

I employ post-issue measures of return on assets (ROA) and interest coverage (ICOV). Finally,
to experiment with a more direct measure of borrower’s financial health, I compute distance to
default (DTD) using the methodology of the Moody’s KMV. Simply put, DTD measures the
distance (i.e., the number of annual standard deviations) between the borrower’s market value of
assets and non-equity liabilities:
DTD =

Assets − NonEquity Liabilities
Assets × σAssets

The market value and the annual standard deviation of total assets are jointly estimated using
the Black–Scholes formula, where the inputs to the formula are the market value of equity, total
non-equity liabilities, risk-free rate, and stock volatility. The first three variables are as of the
quarter end, whereas stock volatility is estimated using the monthly returns during the 12 months
before the quarter end. Since DTD is noisy, I create a dummy for future financial distress that
indicates whether a firm is in the bottom decile of the sample in terms of its future change in DTD
as a percentage of the initial value.
Next, I illustrate the time horizon used for measuring borrower performance. All accounting
variables are averaged over several quarters in order to minimize the effect of short-term fluctuations. (I also experiment with cumulative ROA as explained later.) The time subscript denotes
the last quarter in a measurement window. Future DTD is measured with a lag after the lending
(and after ROAt+4 and ICOVt+4 are measured), so that changes in fundamentals are reflected in
the firm’s financial health.

To test Hypothesis 2, I employ as the dependent variable the absolute deviation of post-issue
ROA, dev(ROA) = |ROA − E[ROA]|, where E[ROA] is the sample average of post-issue ROA
within the originating bank’s SALES decile. I omit tests of Hypothesis 2 with stock returns, interest
coverage, and DTD, since these variables inevitably contain significant noise. In particular, the
second moment of stock returns is likely to have too many determinants for my hypothesis to
have any explanatory power.
The test results for Hypotheses 1 and 2 are given next. The test of Hypothesis 3 is left to
Section 4.4, as the methodology is sufficiently different from that employed in tests of the other
hypotheses.
4.3. Results: credit standards and borrower quality
I start by describing the change in overall borrower prospects, as proxied by post-issue stock
returns. In Fig. 4, I plot the ex-post buy-and-hold stock returns of borrowers averaged in each
SALES decile. The mean returns start at about 0% for borrowers of nonsellers, jump to about 20%
for sellers, before dropping back to 0% for active sellers. Fig. 4 also shows that the pattern is similar

Fig. 4. The top curve is the average 1-year buy-and-hold stock returns after the loan origination by each loan-sales decile.
Decile 0 indicates the nonseller subsample. The bottom two curves give the mean returns after adjusting for the valueand the equal-weighted market returns.

Fig. 5. This figure illustrates the average post-issue profitability change for each loan-sales decile. Profitability change is
cum(ROAt+x ) − ROAt , where cum(ROAt+x ) is the cumulative return on assets for x quarters after the loan issue.

when stock returns are corrected for CRSP market returns (value- and equal-weighted).20 Moreover, in multivariate OLS regressions, I find that this pattern in stock returns is robust to controls
for stock-return volatility (prior and ex post), firm size, and market return. The effect is statistically
significant with economic magnitudes similar to the values shown in Fig. 4 (untabulated).
I then demonstrate the variation in post-issue ROA using alternative time horizons of 4–7
quarters after the loan issue. Fig. 5 plots the mean value of cum(ROAt+x ) − ROAt in each SALES
decile, where cum(ROAt+x ) is the cumulative return on assets over the x quarters after the loan
issue. The inverse-U-shaped pattern observed with stock returns is also apparent in the relation
between loan sales and post-issue borrower fundamentals; the latter demonstrates an initial hike
for moderate sellers and a drop for active sellers.
To gauge the pattern’s statistical significance and robustness to controls for observable borrower
quality, I run OLS regressions that control for an array of indicators of borrower performance
observed at the time of the loan issue: return on assets, return on equity, interest coverage (due to
outliers, it is used as a dummy variable that indicates values greater than 2), leverage, firm size,
stock return volatility, and average monthly stock returns.21 I also include dummy variables for
the year of lending, borrower’s 1-digit SIC, and S&P credit rating.
20 This finding does not make a statement about market efficiency, since the information on loan originations and relative
loan-sales ranks of the banks may not be publicly available to investors in a timely manner.
21 More explicit definitions of these variables are as follows (the numbers refer to the quarterly Compustat items).
ROA = (8 + 22)/44, interest coverage = (22 + 23)/22, leverage = 54/44, firm size = 44, return on equity = 25/59. These vari-

Fig. 6. This figure illustrates the fraction of borrowers with future financial distress in each SALES decile. A firm is
considered financially distressed if its future change in distance-to-default (as a percentage of the initial value) falls within
the bottom sample decile. Distance-to-default, in turn, is computed with the methodology recommended by Moody’s KMV.
The future change is the difference between the current distance-to-default (average value for the past four quarters) and
the future distance-to-default (average value for the three quarters starting a year after the loan origination).

The dependent variable in Table 4, panel A is the change in the cumulative return on assets,
cum(ROAt+4 ) − ROAt . SELLER has a coefficient estimate that is positive and statistically significant, whereas ACTIVE coefficient is negative and significant. Put differently, average borrower
quality is initially increasing in loan sales, before dropping for borrowers of the most active sellers.
In panels B and C, I check robustness to different functional forms of ROA. The dependent variable
in panel B is the change in the moving average of borrower profitability, ma(ROAt+4 ) − ROAt .
In panel C, I use future average borrower profitability, ma(ROAt+4 ), controlling for past profitability, ROAt . In both cases, the results are similar, consistent with the level effect predicted by
Hypothesis 1.
To test the dispersion effect of Hypothesis 2, I regress dev(cum(ROAt+4 ) − ROAt )) on the
same set of explanatory variables as those used earlier. The estimated coefficients for SELLER
and ACTIVE, as shown in panel D, carry negative and positive signs, respectively. As predicted by
the hypothesis, the cross-sectional variation in borrower quality is lower among moderate sellers
than it is among nonsellers and active sellers.22
Finally, I employ a more direct measure of financial health than ROA or interest coverage. As
explained in Section 4.2, future distress is an indicator that is equal to 1 if the change in DTD is
in the bottom decile of the sample, where change in DTD is defined as (DTDt+7 − DTDt )/DTDt .
(The difference is scaled by past DTD, since the same magnitude of change in DTD indicates a
more significant change in default likelihood for lower initial values of DTD.)
In Fig. 6, I illustrate the percentage of firms in each SALES decile for which future distress
indicator is one. About 14% of borrowers in the nonseller group fall in the distress group, compared
with approximately 10% of borrowers in the moderate SALES deciles. Supporting the earlier
results, the ratio rises to 16% in the top decile. For a multivariate test, I also ran a probit regression
with future distress as the dependent variable and the same set of control variables used in the earlier
tests, and found statistically significant coefficients on SELLER and ACTIVE, with negative and
positive signs, respectively (results not tabulated to save space).
ables are averaged over the four quarters before the loan origination. Volatility and average stock returns are measured
during the 12 months before the loan origination, using CRSP monthly returns.
22 The results are similar if the dependent variable is dev(ma(ROA ) − ROA )), or dev(ma(ROA )) instead. I also

In general, the small-sample analysis of this section at the borrower-level reaffirms the conclusion of the bank-level analysis presented in Section 3: There is a nonmonotonic relation between
loan-portfolio quality and bank lending opportunities—a pattern that, in light of my model, I
attribute to the variation in credit standards.
4.4. Results: credit standards and loan pricing
I regress the loan yield (all-in-drawn spread over a benchmark rate such as LIBOR) on
the likely determinants of loan pricing. In particular, I investigate how post-issue change in
distance to default (DTD) is correlated with loan pricing in each bank category, after controlling for an array of borrower, loan, and bank characteristics. If the bank applies high lending
standards, I expect a stronger correlation between future DTD and the yield spread on the
loan.
I include as control variables the length of the firm–bank relationship, a statewide Herfindahl
index, bank size, bank capitalization ratio, borrower size, interest coverage, ROA, current ratio,
leverage, stock volatility, maturity of the loan contract, deal size, indicators for whether the loan
is senior or secured, credit spread between Moody’s Baa and Bbb bond indices, indicators for
year of lending, borrower S&P credit rating, borrower industry, loan style, and loan purpose. The
details on these variables are left to Appendix A.
To see how strongly future DTD is correlated with loan price in each loan-sales category,
I interact future DTD with each of the following three indicators: (1) a dummy that indicates
if SALES is zero (NONSELLER), (2) a dummy that indicates if SALES is in the top decile
(ACTIVE), and (3) a dummy that indicates that SALES is positive but not in the top decile
(MODERATE).
In panel A of Table 5, I regress the all-in-drawn spread on the interaction of future DTD and
loan-sales dummies, controlling for past DTD and the other determinants of loan price. (MODERATE) × (DTDt+7 ) interaction term is negative and statistically significant (t-statistic = 4.41).
Put differently, among banks with moderate lending opportunities, a larger distance to default in
the future implies cheaper loans for borrowers. The effect is statistically insignificant among
nonsellers (t-statistic = 0.59), and only weakly significant among the most active sellers (tstatistic = 1.74).
In panels B and C, I interact the three SALES indicators with the change in DTD (DTDt+7 ) and
the scaled change in DTD (DTDt+7 /DTDt ), respectively. As before, there is a strong negative
correlation between future change in DTD and loan price only among moderate sellers. The
coefficient estimate for the interaction term, despite its negative sign, is insignificant among
nonsellers (t-statistic is 0.79 and 0.91 in panels B and C, respectively), or is positive among active
sellers.
Finally, we might have concerns about interpreting the change in future DTD as a clean
measure of ex-post borrower performance that is unpredictable at the time of lending, since
future DTD may be correlated with past DTD and other past performance indicators. To minimize the confounding effects of this correlation, therefore, I compute the portion of future
DTD that is not predicted by past variables. I thus first regress the scaled change in future
DTD (DTDt+7 /DTDt ) on past borrower characteristics (the logarithm of firm size, indicator for
ICOV > 2, indicator for current ratio >2, ROA, leverage, stock volatility, credit spread, indicators
for industry, credit-rating, and year), and then interact the residuals obtained from this regression
with the NONSELLER, MODERATE, and ACTIVE dummies. Alleviating the above concern,
the loan-pricing results get even stronger, as seen in Table 5, panel D. The interaction terms of

The dependent variable is the all-in-drawn spread in basis points for sole-lender loan facilities in the 1987–1993 Dealscan sample. Indicators for borrower credit ratings, years,
1-digit borrower SIC, loan style, and purpose are included in all specifications. SELLER indicates whether SALES is positive, and ACTIVE indicates whether SALES is in the
top SALES decile. SALES denotes the total amount of C&I loans sold by the bank during the year of lending divided by the average C&I loans on the balance sheet. DTD is
distance to default, estimated with the methodology of the Moody’s KMV. DTD in alternative functional forms is interacted with NONSELLER, MODERATE and ACTIVE
indicators. In Panels A, B, and C, respectively, DTD appears as the future level (DTDt+7 ), the change (DTDt+7 ), or the percentage change (DTDt+7 /DTDt ). NONSELLER is
equal to 1 when SALES is zero, and MODERATE is equal to 1 when a bank is a SELLER but not ACTIVE. In Panel D, instead of DTDt+7 /DTDt , I use the residuals obtained
by regressing DTDt+7 /DTDt on past firm size, indicator for ICOV > 2, indicator for current ratio > 2, ROA, leverage, dummy for leverage > 0.80, stock volatility, credit spread,
as well as dummies for 1-digit SIC, credit ratings, and years. See the appendix for more details on the variables.

residual DTD with NONSELLER and ACTIVE now both carry a positive sign (although insignificantly), while the interaction term for MODERATE is still negative and statistically significant
(coefficient = −15.45, t-statistic = 1.96).23
This finding also addresses another potential concern. As shown in panels A through C, the
coefficient estimate on the NONSELLER–DTD interaction is insignificant, but has a negative sign
and a nontrivial magnitude. This result could be due to the fact that these tests have more power
for moderate sellers than they do for nonsellers; the moderate-seller sample contains disproportionately more observations than does the nonseller sample. However, while this statistical-power
argument could explain the low t-statistics on NONSELLER–DTD reported in panels A through
C, it would not explain the positive sign on this coefficient obtained when future DTD is net of
its predictable part.
In summary, post-issue borrower performance is significantly correlated with loan pricing only
among banks with moderate loan sales. This result provides further support for the hypothesis
that credit standards are stricter among banks with moderate lending opportunities than they are
among those with lending opportunities at either end of the quality spectrum.
5. Conclusion
In general, one would expect the quality of a bank’s loan portfolio to be monotonically increasing in the quality of its loan pool. However, this prediction does not necessarily hold when banks
possess a costly credit-screening technology. Motivated by the Ruckes (2004) model, which
shows that marginal benefits to lenders of screening out bad loans should be the highest when
the quality of the loan pool is toward the middle of the quality spectrum, I hypothesize and
show empirically that bank portfolio quality can be decreasing at high levels of bank lending
opportunities.
Since innovations in credit standards likely translate into fluctuations in credit availability
and real output, the pattern should be scrutinized also for their macroeconomic implications.
My empirical results here point to a potentially destabilizing feedback effect of credit standards
on business cycles. Under normal business conditions banks are increasingly more careful in
screening out bad projects. When times get worse, banks are screening less, and thus funding
fewer loans, resulting in credit rationing for some productive projects. When times get substantially
better, the subsequent relaxing of lending standards increases the credit supply resulting in more
funding for unproductive projects, which in turn increases bank risk. As such, these findings might
speak to regulators’ concerns about lending standards getting too tight at economic downturns
and too lax at boom periods.
