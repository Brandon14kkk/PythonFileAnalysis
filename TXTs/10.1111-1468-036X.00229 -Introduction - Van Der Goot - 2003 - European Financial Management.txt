This special issue is devoted to initial public offerings (IPOs). The trigger for this issue
has been the ABN-AMRO conference on IPOs in July 2000 with Jay Ritter as keynote
speaker. With the exception of the contribution of Jay Ritter, all papers in this issue
have been presented and discussed at the IPO conference in July 2000.1 While a
number of key issues are addressed by the authors of this issue, Ritter in his survey
claims that several important research questions about the capital raising process are
natural candidates of future research for a better understanding of capital markets
and its players. For example, while explanations for the underpricing in the 1980s and
early 1990s emphasised equilibrium underpricing with asymmetric information, the
extreme underpricing of the internet bubble period of 1999–2000 seems to be better
explained with models built on agency conflicts and behavioural aspects of economic
agents.
Sigrid Vandemaele examines the determinants of the issue procedure choice of
firms that went public on the French Second Marché. Unlike the fixed-price offering,
the auction-like procedure is increasing in the number of secondary shares sold by
venture capitalists and investment banks. Depending on the owners’ participation in
the offering, Vandemaele’s empirical results show that an auction is a more efficient
selling mechanism. It reduces the valuation uncertainty surrounding an offering. Also,
her study provides evidence that auctions are more efficient in incorporating recent
market momentum in the offer price compared to the fixed-price procedure.
Ranko Jelic and Richard Briston report on the Polish privatisation strategy and the
financial performance of the companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Their
results highlight the importance of the choice of privatisation strategy and method
and contradict the pressure for a rapid privatisation programme often imposed by
various national policy makers and international institutions. Although the Polish
government has tried to manage the timing of the privatisations, Jelic and Briston
found that government IPOs did not experience greater underpricing than their
private sector counterparts.
Peter Roosenboom and Tjalling van der Goot address the relation between IPO firm
value and the use of takeover defences, a widely spread phenomenon in the Netherlands.
The empirical results provide evidence that several corporate governance mechanisms
are positively related to firm value, such as granting stock options to all employees, the
proportion of independent directors in the supervisory board and monitoring by large

Introduction

shareholders. Retained management ownership over 50% and the use of non-voting
certificates of shares decrease an IPO firm value, on the other hand.
Finally, Giancarlo Giudici and Stefano Paleari analyse whether the tax incentives
for IPO firms in Italy have caused a loss of wealth for the tax authorities, or, on the
contrary, have stimulated the newly listed firms to report higher earnings, and, hence,
increased tax revenues. Giudici and Paleari find that the increase of the total taxable
income reported by these firms largely counterbalances the effect of the tax rate
reduction. When the relief is over tax revenues rise considerably and the government
obtains a wealth gain. An IPO lowers the incentive to compress the taxable earnings
through tax planning operations. Therefore, tax relief for IPO firms may increase
both the efficiency of stock markets and improve the firms’ ‘fair play’.
Last, but not least, the conference and this special issue on IPOs would not have
been possible without the contribution of many people and organisations. In
particular, the grants from the ABN-AMRO Bank and Euronext Amsterdam are
gratefully acknowledged.
