In theory, the sum of squares of log returns sampled at high frequency estimates their
variance. When market microstructure noise is present but unaccounted for, however,
we show that the optimal sampling frequency is finite and derives its closed-form
expression. But even with optimal sampling, using say 5-min returns when transactions are recorded every second, a vast amount of data is discarded, in contradiction
to basic statistical principles. We demonstrate that modeling the noise and using all
the data is a better solution, even if one misspecifies the noise distribution. So the
answer is: sample as often as possible.

Over the past few years, price data sampled at very high frequency have
become increasingly available in the form of the Olsen dataset of currency
exchange rates or the TAQ database of NYSE stocks. If such data were
not affected by market microstructure noise, the realized volatility of the
process (i.e., the average sum of squares of log-returns sampled at high
frequency) would estimate the returns’ variance, as is well known. In fact,
sampling as often as possible would theoretically produce in the limit a
perfect estimate of that variance.
We start by asking whether it remains optimal to sample the price
process at very high frequency in the presence of market microstructure
noise, consistently with the basic statistical principle that, ceteris paribus,
more data are preferred to less. We first show that, if noise is present but
unaccounted for, then the optimal sampling frequency is finite, and we

derive a closed-form formula for it. The intuition for this result is as
follows. The volatility of the underlying efficient price process and the
market microstructure noise tend to behave differently at different frequencies. Thinking in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, a log-return observed
from transaction prices over a tiny time interval is mostly composed of
market microstructure noise and brings little information regarding the
volatility of the price process since the latter is (at least in the Brownian
case) proportional to the time interval separating successive observations.
As the time interval separating the two prices in the log-return increases,
the amount of market microstructure noise remains constant, since each
price is measured with error, while the informational content of volatility
increases. Hence very high frequency data are mostly composed of market
microstructure noise, while the volatility of the price process is more
apparent in longer horizon returns. Running counter to this effect is the
basic statistical principle mentioned above: in an idealized setting where
the data are observed without error, sampling more frequently can be
useful. What is the right balance to strike? What we show is that these two
effects compensate each other and result in a finite optimal sampling
frequency (in the root mean squared error sense) so that some time
aggregation of the returns data is advisable.
By providing a quantitative answer to the question of how often one
should sample, we hope to reduce the arbitrariness of the choices that have
been made in the empirical literature using high frequency data: for
example, using essentially the same Olsen exchange rate series, these
somewhat ad hoc choices range from 5-min intervals [e.g., Andersen
et al. (2001), Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002), Gençay et al.
(2002) to as long as 30 min [e.g., Andersen et al. (2003)]. When calibrating
our analysis to the amount of microstructure noise that has been reported
in the literature, we demonstrate how the optimal sampling interval
should be determined: for instance, depending upon the amount of microstructure noise relative to the variance of the underlying returns, the
optimal sampling frequency varies from 4 min to 3 h, if 1 day’s worth of
data are used at a time. If a longer time period is used in the analysis, then
the optimal sampling frequency can be considerably longer than these
values.
But even if one determines the sampling frequency optimally, the fact
remains that the empirical researcher is not making full use of the data at
his disposal. For instance, suppose that we have available transaction
records on a liquid stock, traded once every second. Over a typical 6.5 h
day, we therefore start with 23,400 observations. If one decides to sample
once every 5 minutes, then — whether or not this is the optimal sampling
frequency — it amounts to retaining only 78 observations. Stated differently, one is throwing away 299 out of every 300 transactions. From a
statistical perspective, this is unlikely to be the optimal solution, even

Sampling and Market Microstructure Noise

though it is undoubtedly better than computing a volatility estimate using
noisy squared log-returns sampled every second. Somehow, an optimal
solution should make use of all the data, and this is where our analysis is
headed next.
So, if one decides to account for the presence of the noise, how should
one proceed? We show that modeling the noise term explicitly restores
the first order statistical effect that sampling as often as possible is optimal. This will involve an estimator different from the simple sum of
squared log-returns. Since we work within a fully parametric framework,
likelihood is the key word. Hence we construct the likelihood function for
the observed log-returns, which include microstructure noise. To do so, we
must postulate a model for the noise term. We assume that the noise is
Gaussian. In light of what we know from the sophisticated theoretical
microstructure literature, this is likely to be overly simplistic and one may
well be concerned about the effect(s) of this assumption. Could it be more
harmful than useful? Surprisingly, we demonstrate that our likelihood
correction, based on the Gaussianity of the noise, works even if one
misspecifies the assumed distribution of the noise term. Specifically, if
the econometrician assumes that the noise terms are normally distributed
when in fact they are not, not only is it still optimal to sample as often as
possible (unlike the result when no allowance is made for the presence of
noise), but the estimator has the same variance as if the noise distribution
had been correctly specified. This robustness result is, we think, a major
argument in favor of incorporating the presence of the noise when estimating continuous time models with high frequency financial data, even if
one is unsure about the true distribution of the noise term.
In other words, the answer to the question we pose in our title is ‘‘as
often as possible,’’ provided one accounts for the presence of the noise
when designing the estimator (and we suggest maximum likelihood as a
means of doing so). If one is unwilling to account for the noise, then one
has to rely on the finite optimal sampling frequency we start our analysis
with. However, we stress that while it is optimal if one insists upon using
sums of squares of log-returns, this is not the best possible approach to
estimate volatility given the complete high frequency dataset at hand.
In a companion paper [Zhang, Mykland, and Aı̈t-Sahalia (2003)], we
study the corresponding nonparametric problem, where the volatility of
the underlying price is a stochastic process, and nothing else is known
about it, in particular no parametric structure. In that case, the object of
interest is the integrated volatility of the process over a fixed time interval,
such as a day, and we show how to estimate it using again all the data
available (instead of sparse sampling at an arbitrarily lower frequency of,
say, 5 min). Since the model is nonparametric, we no longer use a likelihood approach but instead propose a solution based on subsampling and
averaging, which involves estimators constructed on two different time

scales, and demonstrate that this again dominates sampling at a lower
frequency, whether arbitrarily or optimally determined.
This article is organized as follows. We start by describing in Section 1
our reduced form setup and the underlying structural models that support
it. We then review in Section 2 the base case where no noise is present,
before analyzing in Section 3 the situation where the noise is ignored. In
Section 4, we examine the concrete implications of this result for empirical
work with high frequency data. Next, we show in Section 5 that accounting for the presence of the noise through the likelihood restores the
optimality of high frequency sampling. Our robustness results are presented in Section 6 and interpreted in Section 7. In Section 8, we study the
same questions when the observations are sampled at random time intervals, which are an essential feature of transaction-level data. We then turn
to various extensions and relaxation of our assumptions in Section 9; we
added a drift term, then serially correlated and cross-correlated noise
respectively. In Section 10 concludes. All proofs are in the appendix.
1. Setup
Our basic setup is as follows. We assume that the underlying process of
interest, typically the log-price of a security, is a time-homogeneous
diffusion on the real line
dXt ¼ mðXt ; uÞdt þ sdWt ,

ð1Þ

where X0 ¼ 0, Wt is a Brownian motion, m(., .) is the drift function, s2 the
diffusion coefficient, and u the drift parameters, where u 2 Q and s > 0.
The parameter space is an open and bounded set. As usual, the restriction
that s is constant is without loss of generality since in the univariate case a
one-to-one transformation can always reduce a known specification s(Xt)
to that case. Also, as discussed in Aı̈t-Sahalia and Mykland (2003), the
properties of parametric estimators in this model are quite different
depending upon whether we estimate u alone, s2 alone, or both parameters together. When the data are noisy, the main effects that we describe
are already present in the simpler of these three cases, where s2 alone is
estimated, and so we focus on that case. Moreover, in the high frequency
context we have in mind, the diffusive component of (1) is of order (dt)1/2
while the drift component is of order dt only, so the drift component is
mathematically negligible at high frequencies. This is validated empirically: including a drift which actually deteriorates the performance of variance estimates from high frequency data since the drift is estimated with a
large standard error. Not centering the log returns for the purpose of
variance estimation produces more accurate results [see Merton (1980)].
So we simplify the analysis one step further by setting m ¼ 0, which we do

until Section 9.1, where we then show that adding a drift term does
not alter our results. In Section 9.4, we discuss the situation where the
instantaneous volatility s is stochastic.
But for now,
Xt ¼ sWt :

ð2Þ

Until Section 8, we treat the case where our observations occur at equidistant time intervals D, in which case the parameter s2 is estimated at
time T on the basis of N þ 1 discrete observations recorded at times t 0 ¼ 0,
t 1 ¼ D, . . . ,t N ¼ N D ¼ T. In Section 8, we let the sampling intervals themselves be random variables, since this feature is an essential characteristic
of high frequency transaction data.
The notion that the observed transaction price in high frequency financial data is the unobservable efficient price plus some noise component
due to the imperfections of the trading process is a well established
concept in the market microstructure literature [see, for instance Black
(1986)]. So, we depart from the inference setup previously studied
[Aı̈t-Sahalia and Mykland (2003)] and we now assume that, instead of
observing the process X at dates t i, we observe X with error:
~ ti ¼ Xti þ Uti ,
X

ð3Þ

where the Utis are i.i.d. noise with mean zero and variance a2 and are
independent of the W process. In this context, we view X as the efficient
~ is the transaction log-price. In an efficient
log-price, while the observed X
market, Xt is the log of the expectation of the final value of the security
conditional on all publicly available information at time t. It corresponds
to the log-price that would be, in effect, in a perfect market with no trading
imperfections, frictions, or informational effects. The Brownian motion
W is the process representing the arrival of new information, which in this
idealized setting is immediately impounded in X.
By contrast, Ut summarizes the noise generated by the mechanics of the
trading process. We view the source of noise as a diverse array of market
microstructure effects, either information or non-information related,
such as the presence of a bid-ask spread and the corresponding bounces,
the differences in trade sizes and the corresponding differences in representativeness of the prices, the different informational content of price
changes owing to informational asymmetries of traders, the gradual
response of prices to a block trade, the strategic component of the order
flow, inventory control effects, the discreteness of price changes in markets that are not decimalized, etc., all summarized into the term U. That
these phenomena are real and important and this is an accepted fact in the
market microstructure literature, both theoretical and empirical. One can
in fact argue that these phenomena justify this literature.

We view Equation (3) as the simplest possible reduced form of structural market microstructure models. The efficient price process X is typically modeled as a random walk, that is, the discrete time equivalent of
Equation (2). Our specification coincides with that of Hasbrouck (1993),
who discusses the theoretical market microstructure underpinnings of
such a model and argues that the parameter a is a summary measure of
market quality. Structural market microstructure models do generate
Equation (3). For instance, Roll (1984) proposes a model where U is due
entirely to the bid-ask spread. Harris (1990b) notes that in practice there
are sources of noise other than just the bid-ask spread, and studies their
effect on the Roll model and its estimators.
Indeed, a disturbance U can also be generated by adverse selection
effects as in Glosten (1987) and Glosten and Harris (1988), where the
spread has two components: one that is owing to monopoly power, clearing costs, inventory carrying costs, etc., as previously, and a second one
that arises because of adverse selection whereby the specialist is concerned
that the investor on the other side of the transaction has superior information. When asymmetric information is involved, the disturbance U
would typically no longer be uncorrelated with the W process and would
exhibit autocorrelation at the first order, which would complicate our
analysis without fundamentally altering it: see Sections 9.2 and 9.3
where we relax the assumptions that the Us are serially uncorrelated and
independent of the W process.
The situation where the measurement error is primarily due to the fact
~ ti ¼ mi k where k is
that transaction prices are multiples of a tick size (i.e., X
the tick size and mi is the integer closest to Xti /k) can be modeled as a
rounding off problem [see Gottlieb and Kalay (1985), Jacod (1996),
Delattre and Jacod (1997)]. The specification of the model in Harris
(1990a) combines both the rounding and bid-ask effects as the dual
sources of the noise term U. Finally, structural models, such as that of
Madhavan, Richardson, and Roomans (1997), also give rise to reduced
~ takes the form of an unobforms where the observed transaction price X
served fundamental value plus error.
With Equation (3) as our basic data generating process, we now turn
to the questions we address in this article: how often should one sample
a continuous-time process when the data are subject to market microstructure noise, what are the implications of the noise for the estimation
of the parameters of the X process, and how should one correct for the
presence of the noise, allowing for the possibility that the econometrician
misspecifies the assumed distribution of the noise term, and finally
allowing for the sampling to occur at random points in time? We proceed from the simplest to the most complex situation by adding one
extra layer of complexity at a time: Figure 1 shows the three sampling
schemes we consider, starting with fixed sampling without market

Two important properties of the log-returns Yi s emerge from Equations
(9) and (10). First, it is clear from Equation (9) that microstructure noise
leads to spurious variance in observed log-returns, s2D þ 2a2 versus s2D.
This is consistent with the predictions of theoretical microstructure
models. For instance, Easley and O’Hara (1992) develop a model linking
the arrival of information, the timing of trades, and the resulting price
process. In their model, the transaction price will be a biased representation of the efficient price process, with a variance that is both overstated
and heteroskedastic due to the fact that transactions (hence the recording
~ ) occur at intervals that are timeof an observation on the process X
varying. While our specification is too simple to capture the rich joint
dynamics of price and sampling times predicted by their model, heteroskedasticity of the observed variance will also appear in our case
once we allow for time variation of the sampling intervals (see Section 8).
In our model, the proportion of the total return variance that is market
microstructure-induced is
p¼

2a2
þ 2a2

s2 D

ð13Þ

at observation interval D. As D gets smaller, p gets closer to 1, so that a
larger proportion of the variance in the observed log-return is driven by
market microstructure frictions, and correspondingly a lesser fraction
reflects the volatility of the underlying price process X.
Second, Equation (10) implies that 1 < h < 0, so that logreturns are (negatively) autocorrelated with first order autocorrelation
a2/(s2D þ 2a2) ¼ p/2. It has been noted that market microstructure
noise has the potential to explain the empirical autocorrelation of returns.
For instance, in the simple Roll model, Ut ¼ (s/2)Qt where s is the bid/ask

spread and Qt, the order flow indicator, is a binomial variable that takes
the values þ1 and 1 with equal probability. Therefore, var[Ut] ¼ a2 ¼ s2/4.
Since cov(Yi,Yi  1) ¼ a2, the bid/ask spread can be recovered in this
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
model as s ¼ 2 r where r ¼ g2h is the first-order autocorrelation of
returns. French and Roll (1986) proposed to adjust variance estimates to
control for such autocorrelation and Harris (1990b) studied the resulting
estimators. In Sias and Starks (1997), U arises because of the strategic
trading of institutional investors which is then put forward as an explanation for the observed serial correlation of returns. Lo and MacKinlay
(1990) show that infrequent trading has implications for the variance and
autocorrelations of returns. Other empirical patterns in high frequency
financial data have been documented: leptokurtosis, deterministic
patterns, and volatility clustering.
Our first result shows that the optimal sampling frequency is finite when
noise is present but unaccounted for. The estimator s
^ 2 obtained from
maximizing the misspecified log-likelihood function (4) is quadratic in the
Yi s [see Equation (5)]. In order to obtain its exact (i.e., small sample)
variance, we need to calculate the fourth order cumulants of the Yi s since

(since W is normal, the log-returns are also normal in that case). If the
distribution of U is binomial as in the simple bid/ask model described
above, then cum4 [U ] ¼ s4/8; since in general s will be a tiny percentage
of the asset price, say s ¼ 0.05%, the resulting cum4 [U ] will be very small.

The trade-off between bias and variance made explicit in Equations (17)
and (18) is not unlike the situation in nonparametric estimation with D1
playing the role of the bandwidth h. A lower h reduces the bias but
increases the variance, and the optimal choice of h balances the two
effects.
Note that these are exact small sample expressions, valid for all T.
Asymptotically in T, var½^

is dominated by the bias term which is independent of T. And given the
form of the bias (17), one would in fact want to select the largest D possible
to minimize the bias (as opposed to the smallest one as in the no-noise case
of Section 2). The rate at which D should increase with T is given by
Equation (20). Also, in the limit where the noise disappears (a ! 0 and
cum4 [U ] ! 0), the optimal sampling interval D tends to 0.

The Review of Financial Studies / v 18 n 2 2005

How does a small departure from a normal distribution of the microstructure noise affect the optimal sampling frequency? The answer is that a
small positive (resp. negative) departure of cum4[U] starting from the
normal value of 0 leads to an increase (resp. decrease) in D, since

where Dnormal is the value of D corresponding to Cum4 [U] ¼ 0. And, of
course, the full formula (19) can be used to get the exact answer for any
departure from normality instead of the comparative static one.
Another interesting asymptotic situation occurs if one attempts to use
higher and higher frequency data (D ! 0, say sampled every minute) over
a fixed time period (T fixed, say a day). Since the expressions in Theorem 1
are exact small sample ones, they can in particular be specialized to
analyze this situation. With n ¼ T/D, it follows from Equations (17) and
(18) that

s2 becomes an estimator of E [U2] ¼ a2 whose asymptotic variance is E [U 4]. Note in particular that s
^ 2 estimates the variance of the
noise, which is essentially unrelated to the object of interest s2. This type
of asymptotics is relevant in the stochastic volatility case we analyze in our
companion paper [Zhang, Mykland, and Aı̈t-Sahalia (2003)].
Our results also have implications for the two parallel tracks that have
developed in the recent financial econometrics literature dealing with
discretely observed continuous-time processes. One strand of the literature has argued that estimation methods should be robust to the potential
issues arising in the presence of high frequency data and, consequently, be
asymptotically valid without requiring that the sampling interval D
separating successive observations tend to zero [see, e.g., Hansen and
Scheinkman (1995), Aı̈t-Sahalia (1996), Aı̈t-Sahalia (2002)]. Another
strand of the literature has dispensed with that constraint, and the asymptotic validity of these methods requires that D tend to zero instead of or in
addition to, an increasing length of time T over which these observations

are recorded [see, e.g., Andersen et al. (2003), Bandi and Phillips (2003),
Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002)].
The first strand of literature has been informally warning about the
potential dangers of using high frequency financial data without accounting for their inherent noise [see, e.g., Aı̈t-Sahalia (1996, p. 529)], and we
propose a formal modelization of that phenomenon. The implications of
our analysis are most important for the second strand of the literature,
which is predicated on the use of high frequency data but does not account
for the presence of market microstructure noise. Our results show that the
properties of estimators based on the local sample path properties of the
process (such as the quadratic variation to estimate s2) change dramatically in the presence of noise. Complementary to this are the results of
Gloter and Jacod (2000) which show that the presence of even increasingly
negligible noise is sufficient to adversely affect the identification of s2.
4. Concrete Implications for Empirical Work with High Frequency Data
The clear message of Theorem 1 for empirical researchers working with
high frequency financial data is that it may be optimal to sample less
frequently. As discussed in the Introduction, authors have reduced their
sampling frequency below that of the actual record of observations in a
somewhat ad hoc fashion, with typical choices 5 min and up. Our analysis
provides not only a theoretical rationale for sampling less frequently, but
also gives a precise answer to the question of ‘‘how often one should
sample?’’ For that purpose, we need to calibrate the parameters appearing
in Theorem 1, namely s, a, cum4[U], D and T. We assume in this calibration exercise that the noise is Gaussian, in which case cum4[U ] ¼ 0.
4.1 Stocks
We use existing studies in empirical market microstructure to calibrate the
parameters. One such study is Madhavan, Richardson, and Roomans
(1997), who estimated on the basis of a sample of 274 NYSE stocks that
approximately 60% of the total variance of price changes is attributable to
market microstructure effects (they report a range of values for p from
54% in the first half hour of trading to 65% in the last half hour, see their
Table 4; they also decompose this total variance into components due to
discreteness, asymmetric information, transaction costs and the interaction between these effects). Given that their sample contains an average of
15 transactions per hour (their Table 1), we have in our framework
p ¼ 60%,

D ¼ 1=ð15  7  252Þ:

These values imply from Equation (13) that a ¼ 0.16% if we assume a
realistic value of s ¼ 30% per year. (We do not use their reported

This table reports the optimal sampling frequency D given in Equation 19 for different values of the
standard deviation of the noise term a and the length of the sample T. Throughout the table, the noise
is assumed to be normally distributed (hence cum4[U] ¼ 0 in formula 19). In panel (a), the standard
deviation of the efficient price process is s ¼ 30% per year, and at s ¼ 10% per year in panel (b). In both
panels, 1 year ¼ 252 days, but in panel (a), 1 day ¼ 6.5 hours (both the NYSE and NASDAQ are open for
6.5 h from 9:30 to 16:00 EST), while in panel (b), 1 day ¼ 24 hours as is the case for major currencies. A
value of a ¼ 0.05% means that each transaction is subject to Gaussian noise with mean 0 and standard
deviation equal to 0.05% of the efficient price. If the sole source of the noise were a bid/ask spread of size s,
then a should be set to s/2. For example, a bid/ask spread of 10 cents on a $10 stock would correspond to
a ¼ 0.05%. For the dollar/euro exchange rate, a bid/ask spread of s ¼ 0.04% translates into a ¼ 0.02%. For
the bid/ask model, which is based on binomial instead of Gaussian noise, cum4[U] ¼ s4/8, but this
quantity is negligible given the tiny size of s.

volatility number since they apparently averaged the variance of price
changes over the 274 stocks instead of the variance of the returns. Since
different stocks have different price levels, the price variances across
stocks are not directly comparable. This does not affect the estimated
fraction p, however, since the price level scaling factor cancels out
between the numerator and the denominator.)
The magnitude of the effect is bound to vary by type of security, market
and time period. Hasbrouck (1993) estimates the value of a to be 0.33%.
Some authors have reported even larger effects. Using a sample of NASDAQ stocks, Kaul and Nimalendran (1990) estimate that about 50% of
the daily variance of returns is due to the bid-ask effect. With s ¼ 40%
(NASDAQ stocks have higher volatility), the values
p ¼ 50%,

D ¼ 1=252

yield the value a ¼ 1.8%. Also on NASDAQ, Conrad, Kaul and
Nimalendran (1991) estimate that 11% of the variance of weekly returns
(see their Table 4, middle portfolio) is due to bid-ask effects. The values
p ¼ 11%,

D ¼ 1=52

imply that a ¼ 1.4%.
In Table 1, we compute the value of the optimal sampling interval D
implied by different combinations of sample length (T ) and noise magnitude (a). The volatility of the efficient price process is held fixed at
s ¼ 30% in Panel (A), which is a realistic value for stocks. The numbers
in the table show that the optimal sampling frequency can be substantially
affected by even relatively small quantities of microstructure noise.
For instance, using the value a ¼ 0.15% calibrated from Madhavan,
Richardson, and Roomans (1997), we find an optimal sampling interval
of 22 minutes if the sampling length is 1 day; longer sample lengths lead to
higher optimal sampling intervals. With the higher value of a ¼ 0.3%,
approximating the estimate from Hasbrouck (1993), the optimal sampling
interval is 57 min. A lower value of the magnitude of the noise translates
into a higher frequency: for instance, D ¼ 5 min if a ¼ 0.05% and
T ¼ 1 day. Figure 2 displays the RMSE of the estimator as a function of
D and T, using parameter values s ¼ 30% and a ¼ 0.15%. The figure
illustrates the fact that deviations from the optimal choice of D lead to a
substantial increase in the RMSE: for example, with T ¼ 1 month, the
RMSE more than doubles if, instead of the optimal D ¼ 1 h, one uses
D ¼ 15 min.

This table reports the results of M ¼ 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the estimator s
^ 2 , with market
microstructure noise present but ignored. The column ‘‘theoretical mean’’ reports the expected value of the
estimator, as given in Equation (17) and similarly for the column ‘‘theoretical standard deviation’’ (the
variance is given in Equation (18)). The ‘‘sample’’ columns report the corresponding moments computed
over the M simulated paths. The parameter values used to generate the simulated data are s2 ¼ 0.32 ¼ 0.09
and a2 ¼ (0.15%)2 and the length of each sample is T ¼ 1 year.

4.2 Currencies
Looking now at foreign exchange markets, empirical market microstructure studies have quantified the magnitude of the bid-ask spread. For
example, Bessembinder (1994) computes the average bid/ask spread s in
the wholesale market for different currencies and reports values of
s ¼ 0.05% for the German mark, and 0.06% for the Japanese yen (see
Panel B of his Table 2). We calculated the corresponding numbers for the
1996–2002 period to be 0.04% for the mark (followed by the euro) and
0.06% for the yen. Emerging market currencies have higher spreads: for
instance, s ¼ 0.12% for Korea and 0.10% for Brazil. During the same
period, the volatility of the exchange rate was s ¼ 10% for the German
mark, 12% for the Japanese yen, 17% for Brazil and 18% for Korea. In
Panel B of Table 1, we compute D with s ¼ 10%, a realistic value for the
euro and yen. As we noted above, if the sole source of the noise were a bid/
ask spread of size s, then a should be set to s/2. Therefore, Panel B reports
the values of D for values of a ranging from 0.02% to 0.1%. For example,
the dollar/euro or dollar/yen exchange rates (calibrated to s ¼ 10%,
a ¼ 0.02%) should be sampled every D ¼ 23 min if the overall sample
length is T ¼ 1 day, and every 1.1 h if T ¼ 1 year.
Furthermore, using the bid/ask spread alone as a proxy for all microstructure frictions will lead, except in unusual circumstances, to an understatement of the parameter a, since variances are additive. Thus, since D is
increasing in a, one should interpret the value of D read off 1 on the row
corresponding to a ¼ s/2 as a lower bound for the optimal sampling
interval.
4.3 Monte Carlo Evidence
To validate empirically these results, we perform Monte Carlo simulations. We simulate M ¼ 10,000 samples of length T ¼ 1 year of the process

the log returns Y. We sample the log-returns at various intervals D ranging
from 5 min to 1 week, and calculate the bias and variance of the estimator
s
^ 2 over the M simulated paths. We then compare the results to the
theoretical values given in Equations (17) and (18) of Theorem 1. The
noise distribution is Gaussian, s ¼ 30% and a ¼ 0.15% — the values
we calibrated to stock returns data above. Table 2 shows that the theoretical values are in close agreement with the results of the Monte Carlo
simulations.
Table 2 also illustrates the magnitude of the bias inherent in sampling
at too high a frequency. While the value of s2 used to generate the data is
0.09, the expected value of the estimator when sampling every 5 min is
0.18, so on average the estimated quadratic variation is twice as big as it
should be in this case.
5. Incorporating Market Microstructure Noise Explicitly
So far we have stuck to the sum of squares of log-returns as our estimator
of volatility. We then showed that, for this estimator, the optimal sampling frequency is finite. However, this implies that one is discarding a
large proportion of the high frequency sample (299 out of every 300
observations in the example described in the introduction), in order to
mitigate the bias induced by market microstructure noise. Next, we show
that if we explicitly incorporate the Us into the likelihood function, then
we are back in a situation where the optimal sampling scheme consists in
sampling as often as possible — that is, using all the data available.
Specifying the likelihood function of the log-returns, while recognizing
that they incorporate noise, requires that we take a stand on the distribution of the noise term. Suppose for now that the microstructure noise is
normally distributed, an assumption whose effect we will investigate
below in Section 6. Under this assumption, the likelihood function for
the Ys is given by

From the perspective of practical implementation, this estimator is
nothing else than the MLE estimator of an MA(1) process with Gaussian
errors: any existing computer routines for the MA(1) situation can, therefore, be applied [see e.g., Hamilton (1995, Section 5.4)]. In particular, the
likelihood function can be expressed in a computationally efficient form

misspecified model for them. Specifically, we consider the case where the
Us are assumed to be normally distributed when in reality they have a
different distribution. We still suppose that the Us are i.i.d. with mean zero
and variance a2.
Since the econometrician assumes the Us to have a normal distribution,
inference is still done with the log-likelihood l(s2, a2), or equivalently
l(h, g 2) given in Equation (25), using Equations (9) and (10). This means
that the scores l_s2 and l_a2 , or equivalently Equations (C.1) and (C.2) are
used as moment functions (or ‘‘estimating equations’’). Since the first
order moments of the moment functions only depend on the second
order moment structure of the log-returns (Y1, . . . ,YN), which is
unchanged by the absence of normality, the moment functions are unbiased under the true distribution of the Us:

s2 , ^a2 Þ based on these
and similarly for l_s2 and l_a2 . Hence the estimator ð^
moment functions is consistent and asymptotically unbiased (even though
the likelihood function is misspecified).
The effect of misspecification, therefore, lies in the asymptotic variance
matrix. By using the cumulants of the distribution of U, we express the
asymptotic variance of these estimators in terms of deviations from normality. But as far as computing the actual estimator, nothing has changed
relative to Section 5: we are still calculating the MLE for an MA(1)
process with Gaussian errors and can apply exactly the same computational routine.
However, since the error distribution is potentially misspecified, one
could expect the asymptotic distribution of the estimator to be altered.
This does not happen, as far as s

that the noise is Gaussian is robust to misspecification of the error

Documenting the presence of the correction term through simulations
presents a challenge. At the parameter values calibrated to be realistic, the
order of magnitude of a is a few basis points, say a ¼ 0.10% ¼ 103. But if
U if of order 103, cum4[U] which is of the same order as U 4, is of order

term in Equation (33) will not be visible.
Nevertheless, to make it discernible, we use a distribution for U with the
same calibrated standard deviation a as before, but a disproportionately
large fourth cumulant. Such a distribution can be constructed by letting
U ¼ vTn where v > 0 is constant and Tn is a Student t distribution with v
degrees of freedom. Tn has mean zero, finite variance as long as v > 2 and
finite fourth moment (hence finite fourth cumulant) as long as v > 4. But
as v approaches 4 from above, E½Tn4  tends to infinity. This allows us to
produce an arbitrarily high value of cum4[U] while controlling for the
magnitude of the variance. The specific expressions of a2 and cum4[U] for
this choice of U are given by

Thus, we can select the two parameters (v, n) to produce desired values of
(a2, cum4[U ]). As before, we set a ¼ 0.15%. Then, given the form of the
asymptotic variance matrix Equation (33), we set cum4[U ] so that
cum4 ½UD ¼ avarnormal ð^
a2 Þ=2. This makes avartrue ð^a2 Þ by construction
50% larger than avarnormal ð^
a2 Þ. The resulting values of (v, n) from solving
Equations (34) and (35) are v ¼ 0.00115 and v ¼ 4.854. As above, we set
the other parameters to s ¼ 30%, T ¼ 1 year, and D ¼ 5 minutes. Figure 5
reports histograms of the distributions of s
^ 2 and ^a2 from 10,000 Monte
Carlo simulations. The solid curve plots the asymptotic distribution of the
estimator, given now by Equation (33). There is again good adequacy
between the asymptotic and small sample distributions. In particular, we
note that as predicted by Theorem 2, the asymptotic variance of s
^ 2 is
2
unchanged relative to Figure 4 while that of ^a is 50% larger. The small
sample distribution of s
^ 2 appears unaffected by the non-Gaussianity of
the noise; with a skewness of 0.07 and a kurtosis of 2.95, it is closely
approximated by its asymptotic Gaussian limit. The small sample distribution of ^
a2 does exhibit some kurtosis (4.83), although not large relative
to that of the underlying noise distribution (the values of v and n imply a
kurtosis for U of 3 þ 6/(n  4) ¼ 10). Similar simulations but with a longer
time span of T ¼ 5 years are even closer to the Gaussian asymptotic limit:
the kurtosis of the small sample distribution of ^a2 goes down to 2.99.

Going back to the theoretical aspects, the above Theorem 2 has implications for the use of the Gaussian likelihood l that go beyond consistency,
namely that this likelihood can also be used to estimate the distribution of
s

that the Us are Gaussian, given in Equation (25), €l ð^

correctly specified as Gaussian. Also note, however, that otherwise, so
^ is also a consistent estimate of the matrix

T 1=2 ð^
s2  s2 Þ is consistently estimated by V
true for the covariances, but not, obviously, for the asymptotic variance of
T 1=2 ð^
a2  a2 Þ.
In the likelihood context, the possibility of estimating the asymptotic
variance by the observed information is due to the second Bartlett identity. For a general log likelihood l, if S  Etrue ½l_l_0 =N and D  Etrue ½€l =N
(differentiation refers to the original parameters (s2, a2), not the transformed parameters (g 2, h)) this identity says that
S  D ¼ 0:

ð36Þ

It implies that the asymptotic variance takes the form

1
avar ¼ D DS 1 D ¼ DD1 :

ð37Þ

It is clear that Equation (37) remains valid if the second Bartlett identity
holds only to first order, that is,
S  D ¼ oð1Þ

ð38Þ

as N ! 1, for a general criterion function l which satisfies Etrue ½l_ ¼ oðNÞ.
However, in view of Theorem 2, Equation (38) cannot be satisfied. In
fact, we show in Appendix E that
S  D ¼ cum4 ½U gg0 þ oð1Þ,

From Equation (40), we see that g 6¼ 0 whenever s2 > 0. This is consistent
with the result in Theorem 2 that the true asymptotic variance matrix,
avartrue ð^

avarnormal ð^
s2 , ^
a2 Þ. On the other hand, the 2  2 matrix gg0 is of rank 1,
signaling that there exist linear combinations that will cancel out the first
column of S  D. From what we already know of the form of the correction matrix, D1 gives such a combination that the asymptotic variance of
the original parameters (s2, a2) will have the property that its first column
is not subject to correction in the absence of normality.

A curious consequence of Equation (39) is that while the observed
information can be used to estimate the asymptotic variance of s
^ 2 when
2
2
a is not known, this is not the case when a is known. This is because the
second Bartlett identity also fails to first order when considering a2 to
be known, that is, when differentiating with respect to s2 only. Indeed,
in that case we have from the upper left component in the matrix
Equation (39):

which is not o(1) unless cum4 [U ] ¼ 0.
To make the connection between Theorem 2 and the second Bartlett
identity, one needs to go to the log profile likelihood

Obviously, maximizing the likelihood l(s2, a2) is the same as maximizing
l(s2). Thus one can think of s2 as being estimated (when a2 is unknown)
by maximizing the criterion function l(s2), or by solving l_ ð^
s2 Þ ¼ 0. Also,
the observed profile information is related to the original observed

that is, the first (upper left hand corner) component of the inverse

Appendix E, where we also show that Etrue ½l_  ¼ oðNÞ. In view of Theorem
€ð^

s2 Þ can be used to estimate the asymptotic variance of s

This is indeed the case, as shown in Appendix E.
This phenomenon is related, although not identical, to what occurs in
the context of quasi-likelihood [for comprehensive treatments of quasilikelihood theory, see the books by McCullagh and Nelder (1989) and
Heyde (1997), and the references therein, and for early econometrics
examples, see Macurdy (1982) and White (1982)]. In quasi-likelihood
situations, one uses a possibly incorrectly specified score vector which is

nevertheless required to satisfy the second Bartlett identity. What makes
our situation unusual relative to quasi-likelihood is that the interest
parameter s2 and the nuisance parameter a2 are entangled in the same
estimating equations (l_s2 and l_a2 from the Gaussian likelihood) in such a
way that the estimate of s2 depends, to first order, on whether a2 is known
or not. This is unlike the typical development of quasi-likelihood, where
the nuisance parameter separates out [see, e.g., McCullagh and Nelder
(1989, Table 9.1, p. 326)]. Thus only by going to the profile likelihood l
can one make the usual comparison to quasi-likelihood.
8. Randomly Spaced Sampling Intervals
One essential feature of transaction data in finance is that the time that
separates successive observations is random, or at least time-varying. So,
as in Aı̈t-Sahalia and Mykland (2003), we are led to consider the case
where Di ¼ t i  t i1 are either deterministic and time-varying, or random
in which case we assume for simplicity that they are i.i.d., independent of
the W process. This assumption, while not completely realistic [see Engle
and Russell (1998) for a discrete time analysis of the autoregressive
dependence of the times between trades] allows us to make explicit calculations at the interface between the continuous and discrete time scales.
We denote by NT the number of observations recorded by time T. NT is
random if the Ds are. We also suppose that Uti can be written Ui, where the
Ui are i.i.d. and independent of the W process and the Dis. Thus, the
observation noise is the same at all observation times, whether random or
nonrandom. If we define the Yis as before, in the first two lines of
Equation (8), though the MA(1) representation is not valid in the same
form.
We can do inference conditionally on the observed sampling times, in
light of the fact that the likelihood function using all the available information is
LðYN , DN , . . . , Y1 , D1 ; b, cÞ ¼ LðYN , . . . , Y1 jDN , . . . , D1 ; bÞ
 LðDN , . . . , D1 ; cÞ,
where b are the parameters of the state process, that is (s2, a2), and c are
the parameters of the sampling process, if any (the density of the sampling
intervals density L(DNT, . . . , D1; c) may have its own nuisance parameters
c, such as an unknown arrival rate, but we assume that it does not depend
on the parameters b of the state process). The corresponding loglikelihood function is

Note that in the equally spaced case,  ¼ g2V. But now Y no longer
follows an MA(1) process in general. Furthermore, the time variation in
Dis gives rise to heteroskedasticity as is clear from the diagonal elements of
. This is consistent with the predictions of the model of Easley and
~ is
O’Hara (1992) where the variance of the transaction price process X
heteroskedastic as a result of the influence of the sampling times. In their
model, the sampling times are autocorrelated and correlated with the
evolution of the price process, factors we have assumed away here.
However, Aı̈t-Sahalia and Mykland (2003) show how to conduct likelihood inference in such a situation.

In order to calculate this log-likelihood function in a computationally
efficient manner, it is desirable to avoid the ‘‘brute force’’ inversion of
the N  N matrix . We extend the method used in the MA(1) case (see
Equation (29)) as follows. By Theorem 5.3.1 in Dahlquist and Bj€
orck
(1974), and the development in the proof of their Theorem 5.4.3, we can
decompose  in the form  ¼ LDLT, where L is a lower triangular matrix
whose diagonals are all 1 and D is diagonal. To compute the relevant quantities, their Example 5.4.3 shows that if one writes D ¼

It, therefore, appears that computing the expected value of ln(gi) over the
law of (D1, D2, . . . , Di) will be impractical.
8.1 Expansion around a fixed value of D
To continue further with the calculations, we propose to expand around a
fixed value of D, namely D0 ¼ E [D]. Specifically, suppose now that
Di ¼ D0 ð1 þ eji Þ,

ð52Þ

where e and D0 are nonrandom, the jis are i.i.d. random variables with
mean zero and finite distribution. We will Taylor-expand the expressions
above around e ¼ 0, that is, around the non-random sampling case we
have just finished dealing with. Our expansion is one that is valid when the
randomness of the sampling intervals remains small, that is, when var[Di]
is small, or o(1). Then we have D0 ¼ E [D] ¼ O(1) and var½Di  ¼ D20 e2 var½ji .
The natural scaling is to make the distribution of ji finite, that is,
var[ji] ¼ O(1), so that e2 ¼ O(var[Di]) ¼ o(1). But any other choice would
have no impact on the result since var[Di] ¼ o(1) implies that the product
e2var[ji] is o(1) and whenever we write remainder terms below they can be
expressed as Op(e3j3) instead of just O(e3). We keep the latter notation for
clarity given that we set ji ¼ Op(1). Furthermore, for simplicity, we take
the jis to be bounded.
We emphasize that the time increments or durations Di do not tend to
zero length as e ! 0. It is only the variability of the Dis that goes to zero.
Denote by 0 the value of  when D is replaced by D0, and let X denote
the matrix whose diagonal elements are the terms D0ji, and whose
off-diagonal elements are zero. We obtain the following theorem.

therefore, is an expansion in e after T ! 1.
Note that A(0) is the asymptotic variance matrix already present in
Proposition 1, except that it is evaluated at D0 = E[D]. Note also that the
second order correction term is proportional to var[j], and is therefore
zero in the absence of sampling randomness. When that happens, D ¼ D0
with probability one and the asymptotic variance of the estimator reduces
to the leading term A(0), that is, to the result in the fixed sampling case
given in Proposition 1.
8.2 Randomly spaced sampling intervals and misspecified
microstructure noise
Suppose now, as in Section 6, that the Us are i.i.d., have mean zero and
variance a2, but are otherwise not necessarily Gaussian. We adopt the
same approach as in Section 6, namely to express the estimator’s properties in terms of deviations from the deterministic and Gaussian case. The
additional correction terms in the asymptotic variance are given in the
following result.

The term A(0) is the base asymptotic variance of the estimator, already
present with fixed sampling and Gaussian noise. The term cum4[U ]B(0) is
the correction due to the misspecification of the error distribution. These
two terms are identical to those present in Theorem 2. The terms proportional to e2 are the further correction terms introduced by the randomness
of the sampling. A(2) is the base correction term present even with
Gaussian noise in Theorem 3, and cum4 [U ]B(2) is the further correction
due to the sampling randomness. Both A(2) and B(2) are proportionalto
var[j] and hence vanish in the absence of sampling randomness.

9. Extensions
In this section, we briefly sketch four extensions of our basic model. First,
we show that the introduction of a drift term does not alter our conclusions. Then we examine the situation where market microstructure noise is
serially correlated; there, we show that the insight of Theorem 1 remains
valid, namely that the optimal sampling frequency is finite. Third, we turn
to the case where the noise is correlated with the efficient price signal.
Fourth, we discuss what happens if volatility is stochastic.
In a nutshell, each one of these assumptions can be relaxed without
affecting our main conclusion, namely that the presence of the noise gives
rise to a finite optimal sampling frequency. The second part of our analysis, dealing with likelihood corrections for microstructure noise, will not

necessarily carry through unchanged if the assumptions are relaxed (for
instance, there is not even a known likelihood function if volatility is
stochastic, and the likelihood must be modified if the assumed variancecovariance structure of the noise is modified).
9.1 Presence of a drift coefficient
What happens to our conclusions when the underlying X process has a
drift? We shall see in this case that the presence of the drift does not alter
our earlier conclusions. As a simple example, consider linear drift, that is,
replace Equation (2) with
Xt ¼ mt þ sWt :

The contamination by market microstructure noise is as before: the
observed process is given by Equation (3).

Now let E½€l  be the 3  3 matrix of expected second likelihood derivatives.
Let E½€l  ¼ TE½DD þ oðTÞ. Similarly define covðl_, l_Þ ¼ TE½DS þ oðTÞ.
As before, when the Us have a normal distribution, S ¼ D, and otherwise
that is not the case. The asymptotic variance matrix of the estimators is of
the form avar ¼ E [D]D1SD1.
Let Ds2;a2 be the corresponding 2  2 matrix when estimation is carried
out on s2 and a2 for known m, and Dm is the asymptotic information on m
for known s2 and a2. Similarly define Ss2;a2 and avars2;a2. Since D is block

The asymptotic variance ofð^
s2 , ^
a2 Þ is thus the same as if m were known, in
other words, as if m ¼ 0, which is the case that we focused on in all the
previous sections.
9.2 Serially correlated noise
We now examine what happens if we relax the assumption that the market
microstructure noise is serially independent. Suppose that, instead of being
i.i.d. with mean 0 and variance a2, the market microstructure noise follows
dUt ¼ bUt dt þ cdZt ,

ð58Þ

where b > 0, c > 0 and Z is a Brownian motion independent of W. UDjU0
has a Gaussian distribution with mean ebDU0 and variance c2/2b(1 
e2bD). The unconditional mean and variance of U are 0 and a2 = c2/2b.
The main consequence of this model is that the variance contributed by
the noise to a log-return observed over an interval of time D is now of
order O(D), that is of the same order as the variance of the efficient price
process s2D, instead of being of order O(1) as previously. In other words,
log-prices observed close together have very highly correlated noise terms.
Because of this feature, this model for the microstructure noise would be
less appropriate if the primary source of the noise consists of bid-ask
bounces. In such a situation, the fact that a transaction is on the bid or
ask side has little predictive power for the next transaction, or at least not
enough to predict that two successive transactions are on the same side
with very high probability [although Choi, Salandro, and Shastri (1988)
have argued that serial correlation in the transaction type can be a component of the bid-ask spread, and extended the model of Roll (1984) to
allow for it]. On the other hand, the model (58) can better capture effects
such as the gradual adjustment of prices in response to a shock such as a
large trade. In practice, the noise term probably encompasses both of
these examples, resulting in a situation where the variance contributed
by the noise has both types of components, some of order O(1), some of
lower orders in D.

where the wis are i.i.d. N(0, s2D), the uis are independent of the wis, so we

The result analogous to Theorem 1 is as follows. If one ignores the
presence of this type of serially correlated noise when estimating s2, then
follows the theorem.

so that for large T, starting from a value of c2 in the limit where D ! 0,
increasing D first reduces RMSE [^
s2 ]. Hence the optimal sampling
frequency is finite.
One would expect this type of noise to be not nearly as bad as i.i.d. noise
for the purpose of inferring s2 from high frequency data. Indeed, the
variance of the noise is of the same order O(D) as the variance of the
efficient price process. Thus log returns computed from transaction prices
sampled close together are not subject to as much noise as previously

diverges to infinity as D ! 0: it has the finite limit c . Nevertheless, b2 first
decreases as D increases from 0, since

and qb2/qD ! bc4 < 0 as D ! 0. For large enough T, this is sufficient to
generate a finite optimal sampling frequency.
To calibrate the parameter values b and c, we refer to the same empirical
microstructure studies we mentioned in Section 4. We now have
p ¼ E½u2i =ðs2 D þ E½u2i Þ as the proportion of total variance that is
microstructure-induced; we match it to the numbers in Equation (24)
from Madhavan, Richardson, and Roomans (1997). In their Table 5,
they report the first-order correlation of price changes (hence returns) to
be approximately r ¼ 0.2 at their frequency of observation. Here
r ¼ cov(Yi, Yi1)/var[Yi]. If we match p ¼ 0.6 and r ¼ 0.2, with
s ¼ 30% as before, we obtain (after rounding) c ¼ 0.5 and b ¼ 3  104.
Figure 6 displays the resulting RMSE of the estimator as a function of D
and T. The overall picture is comparable to Figure 2.
As for the rest of the analysis of the article, dealing with likelihood
corrections for microstructure noise, the covariance matrix of the logreturns, g2V in Equation (26) should be replaced by the matrix whose
diagonal elements are

Having modified the matrix g2V, the artificial ‘‘normal’’ distribution that
assumes i.i.d. Us that are N(0, a2) would no longer use the correct second
moment structure of the data. Thus we cannot relate a priori the
asymptotic variance of the estimator of the estimator s
^ 2 to that of the
i.i.d. normal case, as we did in Theorem 2.
9.3 Noise correlated with the price process
We have assumed so far that the U process was uncorrelated with the W
process. Microstructure noise attributable to informational effects is likely
to be correlated with the efficient price process, since it is generated by the
response of market participants to information signals (i.e., to the efficient
price process). This would be the case for instance in the bid-ask model
with adverse selection of Glosten (1987). When the U process is no longer
uncorrelated from the W process, the form of the variance matrix of the
observed log-returns Y must be altered, replacing g 2vij in Equation (26)
with

Sampling and Market Microstructure Noise

Glosten (1987) model (see his Proposition 6), the Us remain stationary, the
transaction noise Uti is uncorrelated with the return noise during the
previous observation period, that is, Uti1  Uti2, and the efficient return
s(Wti  Wti1) is also uncorrelated with the transaction noises Uti+1 and
Uti2. With these in hand, the analysis of the RMSE and its minimum can
then proceed as above. As for the likelihood corrections for microstructure noise, the same caveat as in serially correlated U case applies: having
modified the matrix g 2V, the artificial ‘‘normal’’ distribution would no
longer use the correct second moment structure of the data and the
likelihood must be modified accordingly.
9.4 Stochastic volatility
One important departure from our basic model is the case where volatility
is stochastic. The observed log-returns are still generated by Equation (3).
Now, however, the constant volatility assumption (2) is replaced by
dXt ¼ st dWt :

ð61Þ

The object of interest in much of the literature on high frequency volatility
estimation [see, e.g., Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002), Andersen
et al. (2003)] is then the integral
Z T
s2t dt
ð62Þ
0

over a fixed time period [0,T ], or possibly several such time periods. The
estimation is based on observations 0 = t0 < t1 <    < tn ¼ T, and asymptotic results are obtained when maxDti ! 0. The usual estimator for
Equation (62) is the ‘‘realized variance’’
n 
X


~ tiþ1  X
~ ti 2 :

ð63Þ

i¼1

In the context of stochastic volatility, ignoring market microstructure
noise leads to an even more dangerous situation than when s is constant
and T ! 1. We show in the companion paper Zhang, Mykland, and
Aı̈t-Sahalia (2003) that, after suitable scaling, the realized variance is a
consistent and asymptotically normal estimator — but of the quantity 2a2.
This quantity has, in general, nothing to do with the object of interest
Equation (62). Stated differently, market microstructure noise totally
swamps the variance of the price signal at the level of the realized variance.
To obtain a finite optimal sampling interval, one needs that a2 ! 0 as
n ! 1, that is, the amount of noise must disappear asymptotically. For
further developments on this topic, we refer to Zhang, Mykland, and
Aı̈t-Sahalia (2003).

10. Conclusions
We showed that the presence of market microstructure noise makes it
optimal to sample less often than would otherwise be the case in the
absence of noise, and we determined accordingly the optimal sampling
frequency in closed-form.
We then addressed the issue of what to do about it, and showed that
modeling the noise term explicitly restores the first order statistical effect
that sampling as often as possible is optimal. We also demonstrated that
this remains the case if one misspecifies the assumed distribution of the
noise term. If the econometrician assumes that the noise terms are normally distributed when in fact they are not, not only is it still optimal to
sample as often as possible, but the estimator has the same asymptotic
variance as if the noise distribution had been correctly specified. This
robustness result is, we think, a major argument in favor of incorporating
the presence of the noise when estimating continuous time models with
high frequency financial data, even if one is unsure about what is the true
distribution of the noise term. Hence, the answer to the question we pose
in our title is ‘‘as often as possible,’’ provided one accounts for the presence of the noise when designing the estimator.
Appendix A. Proof of Lemma 1
To calculate the fourth cumulant cum(Yi, Yj, Yk, Yl), recall from Equation (8) that the
observed log-returns are
Yi ¼ sðWti  Wti1 Þ þ Uti  Uti1 :
First, note that the t i are nonrandom, and W is independent of the Us, and has Gaussian
increments. Second, the cumulants are multilinear, so

Out of these terms, only the last is nonzero because W has Gaussian increments (so all
cumulants of its increments of order greater than two are zero), and is independent of the Us
(so all cumulants involving increments of both W and U are also zero). Therefore,

with the second equality following from the independence of Uti and Uti1, and the third from
the fact that the cumulant is of even order.
If max(i, j, k, l ) ¼ min(i, j, k, l ) þ 1, two situations arise. Set m ¼ min(i, j, k, l ) and M ¼
max(i, j, k, l ). Also set s ¼ s(i, j, k, l ) ¼ #{i, j, k, l ¼ m}. If s is odd, say s ¼ 1 with i ¼ m, and
j, k, l ¼ M ¼ m þ 1, we get a term of the form


have terms of the form

then

z3 ¼ r1=3 cosðu=3Þ  31=2 r1=3 sinðu=3Þ:
Only z1 is positive because q > 0 and (D)1/2 > 0 imply that 0 < u < p/2. Therefore
cos(u/3) > 0, so z1 > 0; sin(u/3) > 0, so z3 < 0; and

Thus Equation (B.4) has exactly one root that is positive, and it is given by z1 in
Equation (B.6). Since RMSE½^

We can now retrieve the asymptotic covariance matrix for the original parameters (s2, a2)
from that of the parameters (g 2, h). This follows from the delta method applied to the change

since Y has mean zero [see, e.g., McCullagh (1987, Section 2.3)]. The need for permutation
goes away due to the summing over all indices (i, j, k, l ), and since V 1 ¼ [vij] is symmetric.
When looking at Equation (D.1), note that cumnormal(Yi, Yj, Yk, Yl) ¼ 0, where ‘‘normal’’
denotes a Normal distribution with the same first and second order moments as the true
