Abstract
We examine the link between the liquidity of a ﬁrm’s stock and its ownership structure, speciﬁcally,
how much of the ﬁrm’s stock is owned by insiders and institutions, and how concentrated is their
ownership. We ﬁnd that the liquidity-ownership relation is mostly driven by institutional ownership
rather than insider ownership. Importantly, liquidity is positively related to total institutional
holdings but negatively related to institutional blockholdings. This ﬁnding is consistent with the
hypothesis that while the level of institutional ownership proxies for trading activity, the
concentration of such ownership proxies for adverse selection.

0. Introduction
An unresolved area in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance is the relation between share ownership
structure and liquidity. When considering this relation, researchers focus on two
hypotheses, which we refer to as the adverse selection hypothesis and the trading
hypothesis. The adverse selection hypothesis posits that when informed shareholders
possess superior information compared to outside shareholders, an information asymmetry

arises, which reduces liquidity (e.g., Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980; Glosten and Milgrom,
1985; Kyle, 1985; Easley and O’Hara, 1987). The trading hypothesis, on the other hand,
posits that when investors turn over their portfolio more often, transactions costs are
reduced, which increases liquidity (Demsetz, 1968; Merton, 1987; Schwartz and Shapiro,
1992). Given these two hypotheses, studying the empirical relationship between liquidity
and ownership is complex as different ownership proxies may vary in their suitability for
capturing these two costs with adverse selection costs on the one side, and trading frictions
on the other.
While the focus of most empirical studies on the ownership-liquidity relation is on the
adverse selection hypothesis (e.g., Chiang and Venkatesh, 1988; Kini and Mian, 1995;
Heﬂin and Shaw, 2000; Barabanov and McNamara, 2002), there is no consensus in the
literature about which entities constitute the informed group of investors. Some studies
focus on insiders, some focus on institutions, and some focus on blockholders.1 The fact
that all three groups have been shown to have superior information presents a challenge
for several reasons.
First, adverse selection costs depend on the probability that a market maker trades
with an informed investor. This means that considering only one group of possibly
informed shareholders may underestimate the extent of the actual information asymmetry
that exists. Second, the three groups of investors are overlapping. An institutional
investor can be an insider, an insider can be an institution, and a blockholder can be either
an insider or an institution. Without a partition that effectively separates the three groups
of investors, it would be hard to decide which groups of investors drive the observed
relation.
Third, as discussed above, adverse selection is only one of the factors hypothesized to be
related to liquidity. Group-speciﬁc trading behavior may also be important. In general, it
seems that institutions tend to turn over their portfolio more often than other investors.
For example, mutual funds typically have to trade when exogenous shocks of cash
withdrawals or infusions occur as they are committed to provide funds to unit holders on
demand and to comply with their stated investment policy. In some instances, institutional
portfolio turnover may be driven by agency problems (e.g., window dressing), where a
fund manager seeks to buy winners and sell losers before accounting statements are made
public. Finally, some institutions’ trades are determined primarily by pre-determined
investment objectives, such as indexing; and their trades are largely determined by
movements in the index, which tend to occur continuously. Thus, to the extent that
institutions as a group trade more often, institutional ownership should reduce a market
maker’s required inventory, which in turn may reduce spreads (e.g., Tinic, 1972; Hamilton,
1978; Schwartz and Shapiro, 1992; Gompers and Metrick, 2001).
In view of the foregoing, it seems that whether the predictions of the adverse selection
and trading hypotheses are similar or different may depend on which group we consider
informed. If one takes insiders to be informed, the predictions of the adverse selection and
trading hypotheses on liquidity are similar, that is, higher insider ownership should be
1
Evidence of insiders’ information superiority includes Jaffe (1974), Lin and Howe (1990), Bettis, Coles, and
Lemmon (2000), and Lakonishok and Lee (2001). Evidence of blockholders’ information superiority includes
Bethel, Liebeskind, and Opler (1988), McConnell and Servaes (1990), and Barclay and Holderness (1991).
Evidence of institutions’ information superiority includes Szewczyk, Tsetsekos, and Varma (1992), Alangar,
Balhala, and Rao (1999), and Bartov, Radhakrishnan, and Krimsky (2000).

correlated with lower liquidity. However, if one takes institutions to be the informed
group, the predictions of the two hypotheses are in opposite directions.
In this paper we hope to gain a better understanding of the interplay between these two
hypotheses and their respective relations to liquidity. Toward this end, we construct a highresolution set of ownership data. In broad terms, the argument is that while ownership
level proxies for group-speciﬁc trading behavior, ownership concentration proxies for
information asymmetry as ownership concentration measures quantify the incentives of
few shareholders to obtain, analyze, and trade on information (e.g., Black, 1992; Hartzell
and Starks, 2003). Therefore, we construct both level and concentration measures. The
ownership level variables are insiders, non-insider institutions (that is, institutions or
institutional investors), and others. These three mutually exclusive groups sum up to
100%. The concentration measures are insider blockholders and institutional blockholders, that is, the concentration measures are constructed for the groups of investors
which may be considered informed.
A concrete example of our approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The ﬁgure presents the ownership structure of Microsoft and Federal Express as of Q4
2003. The ownership level is represented by the size of the slice, while the ownership
concentration is represented by the grayscale of the slice; a white slice represents dispersed
ownership in the group, while a dark slice represents a high level of concentration in the
group. The ﬁgure shows that Microsoft has a larger portion of insiders and a smaller
portion of institutional investors than Federal Express. The ﬁgure also shows that while
the institutional holdings of Microsoft shares is dispersed, some institutional blockholders
hold Federal Express shares.
The above approach allows us to analyze within one framework all the ownership
variables that have been used in previous liquidity-ownership studies (blockholder
ownership, institutional ownership, and insider ownership). In some sense we conduct a
horse-race between the different ownership variables and their relations to liquidity. This
horse-race approach is especially important because of the high correlations among the
different ownership variables, as these high correlations can lead to spurious results in the
presence of misspeciﬁcation. Moreover, by partitioning between insiders and institutional
concentration we are able to distinguish between two types of possibly informed investors,
those who are prohibited from trading on information and those who are not. US
securities laws prohibit insiders from trading on private information. In contrast, most
institutional blockholders are permitted to trade on information as they are not classiﬁed
as insiders even if they hold more than 10% of a stock’s outstanding shares.
Because we want to avoid overlaps between institutions and insiders, we gather our
insider ownership data from insider reporting statements (SEC forms 3 and 4). These data
together with institutional investors’ quarterly 13F schedules and the intra-day data of the
NYSE Trades and Quotes (TAQ) data set allow us to construct quarterly ownership and
liquidity variables for 1,369 ﬁrms during the years 1999–2003. We employ several liquidity
measures, including volume measures, turnover, quoted depth and spreads, effective
spread, realized spread, and price impact. We construct a variety of liquidity measures
because recent research argues that trade-based measures are uncorrelated with orderdriven measures (Aitken and Comerton-Forbe, 2003). For our purposes this is especially
important as it seems that trade-based measures should be more correlated with the
trading behavior of shareholders, while order-driven measures should be more correlated
with the adverse selection costs embedded in the ownership structure.

Our results support both the trading and adverse selection hypotheses; however, we ﬁnd
that most of the liquidity–ownership relation is driven by institutional ownership and not
insider ownership. To continue our concrete example, Fig. 2 illustrates Microsoft and
Federal Express ownership level and liquidity changes over the 20 quarters we study in this
paper. One can see from the ﬁgure that changes in the time-weighted spread tend to mirror
changes in institutional holdings. In contrast, there is no apparent correlation between
insiders’ holdings and liquidity.

We ﬁnd that while institutional holdings are positively correlated with liquidity,
suggesting more frequent trades of institutional investors compared to other investors,
institutional concentration is negatively correlated with liquidity, suggesting that
institutional blockholders are perceived by market makers to have superior information.
This relation is rather stable and persistent across all liquidity measures. Further, we ﬁnd
evidence that insider ownership is negatively correlated with trade-based measures of
liquidity, but is positively correlated with some order-driven liquidity measures. These
results support the idea that legal barriers to insider trading are effective, that is, insiders
are not perceived to be among those shareholders that trade on private information.
Finally, our results hold in many different speciﬁcations including a simultaneous
equation speciﬁcation, in which ownership level, ownership concentration, and liquidity
are determined jointly.
Our main contribution to the ﬁnancial literature is to provide an extensive empirical
analysis on the ownership-liquidity relation over a ﬁve-year period. We explore this
relation taking into account the observations that the ownership variables are inherently
related, and further, that liquidity has many dimensions. The construction of the highresolution ownership data, together with the recent availability of the NYSE TAQ intraday data, allows us to achieve this task.
The study proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we present our ownership and liquidity
measures. In Section 2, we provide the sample distribution and a univariate analysis of the

ARTICLE IN PRESS

variables. Section 3 presents the multivariate analysis, which for expositional purpose is
developed in a step-by-step approach that outlines how we handle the high correlations
among the ownership variables. Section 4 provides a simultaneous equations framework
wherein ownership level, ownership concentration, and liquidity are determined jointly. In
Section 5, we verify the robustness of our results. Section 6 concludes.
1. Data
We obtain ownership data from Vickers’ Stock Research, who provided us a time series
of institutional and insider holdings information for the 2,000 largest ﬁrms by asset size as
of December 31, 1998. Because this data set follows the sample ﬁrms over time, we are able
to form quarterly snapshots of insiders’ and institutions’ holdings. We then merge this
information with the NYSE TAQ data set for the period 1999 to 2003, which results in our
being able to use 20 quarters of ownership and intra-day trading data. After excluding
ﬁrms that have multiple share classes and ﬁrms that do not appear in one of the above data
sets, we are left with 1,369 ﬁrms. This sample represents approximately 70% of the market
value of US public equity over the period.
1.1. Ownership
Ownership level variables are well suited to provide us insights about the trading
behavior of shareholders. For instance, in contrast to other shareholder groups, insiders
are subject to legal restrictions such as blackout periods (Bettis, Coles, and Lemmen,
2000). Thus, insiders are likely to trade predominantly on the sell side in order to liquidate
their holdings. Increases in institutional ownership, on the other hand, are expected to lead
to increases in trading volume, the number of trades, visibility, and analyst coverage (e.g.,
Schwartz and Shapiro, 1992).
Distinct from ownership level, ownership concentration measures are a natural proxy
for adverse selection. As ﬁrst noted by Black (1992), the incentive of any investor to obtain
information and trade on it depends on the incentives of other investors to do the same.
A concentration measure can quantify the incentives of any speciﬁc informed investor as it
measures the holdings of the informed investor compared to other investors. Thus, if
institutions are in a position to obtain better information, the probability that a particular
institution will incur the costs to do so is higher if it enjoys a comparatively large
ownership share. Similarly, if insiders are more informed, the probability that any one
insider will trade on such information is larger if the information is held by few rather than
by many. Note that one can think of an insider with large holdings not only as having
more incentives to trade on information, but also as having more precise information than
an insider or institution with smaller holdings. Put differently, it makes sense that Bill
Gates would be more informed about the future of Microsoft than other executives of
Microsoft who hold fewer shares and are less important in the ﬁrm’s decision-making
process.
1.1.1. Ownership level and ownership concentration
Our measure for insider holdings is based on data contained in SEC Form 3 and Form 4.
By law, all insiders, who include all executives, ofﬁcers, and beneﬁcial owners who hold
directly more than 10% of the ﬁrm’s shares outstanding, must report any transaction on

ARTICLE IN PRESS
A. Rubin / Journal of Financial Markets 10 (2007) 219–248

225

these forms within two business days. Vickers provides us an aggregation of all insiders’
holdings based on the last Form 3 or Form 4 ﬁled by the insider where the amount owned
is held directly. To ﬁnd the most recent amount owned, Vickers looks at ﬁlings for which
the transaction date was within the three years prior to the ending year date. Note that
occasionally some ﬁlers report a transaction but do not report the amount owned on that
speciﬁc ﬁling (the amount owned would be null); in this case, Vickers goes to the prior
ﬁling that reported an amount owned.
Our measure for institutional holdings is the combined holdings of all ﬁnancial
institutions that report an SEC Schedule 13F but do not report themselves as insiders on
Form 3 or Form 4. According to rule 16(a)-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an
institutional investor that holds more than 10% of the shares in a company is not
considered an insider, and therefore is not required to submit Forms 3 and 4, if the shares
are held for the beneﬁt of third parties in the ordinary course of business and are not
acquired by such institutions for the purpose of inﬂuencing control over the company. As
our purpose here is to form mutually exclusive sets of insiders and institutions, we exclude
from the institutional holdings measure those institutions that also appear as insiders. We
do this by eliminating from the sample those 13F ﬁlers whose holdings exactly match those
of an insider ﬁler.2
Our measures of insider and institutional concentration are insiders’ blockholdings
and institutional blockholdings. As a proxy for institutional concentration, we also
use the measure of Hartzell and Starks (2003) (hereafter, the HS measure), which is
the sum of the top ﬁve non-insider institutional investors divided by total institutional
holdings. This measure serves as a proxy for the probability that a trade is initiated
by an informed non-insider investor. If the largest institutional investors monitor
the ﬁrm, in which case they possess private information that other institutional and
individual investors do not have, and further, if institutions are responsible for the
majority of daily trading activity (Schwartz and Shapiro, 1992), then the probability of an
informed trade is roughly the percentage of holdings by informed institutions divided by
the percentage of holdings of all institutions. Hartzell and Starks (2003) show that
this measure is related to the ability of management to monitor. Even though institutional
blockholdings are more commonly used, one advantage of the HS measure is that
it is not subject to the arbitrary inclusion cut-off point of 5%. Thus, the HS measure is a
ﬁner measure of concentration if one wants to follow the concentration level of a given
ﬁrm over time.
Note that by partitioning the incentives of insiders and institutions, we are essentially
partitioning between two groups of potentially informed investors. US securities law and
the SEC take insiders as those shareholders that have access to non-public information. If
these shareholders trade on such information, they do so in violation of the securities laws.
In contrast, an institutional blockholder is not considered an insider so long as it does not
inﬂuence control (even if it holds more than 10% of the shares outstanding). Thus, even if
these non-insider institutional blockholders are informed, the SEC perceives their
information as derived from publicly available information and thus they are permitted
to trade on such information.
2
In many cases the ﬁler will appear under one name when it reports itself on a Schedule 13F and under another
name when it reports itself as an insider of the ﬁrm on Form 3 or 4. For example, while Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.
reports itself as Berkshire Hathaway on 13Fs, it commonly appears under other names on Form 3.

1.2. Liquidity
Because liquidity has many facets, no one measure can capture all of its dimensions. For
instance, dollar volume, share volume, and turnover are mostly related to the trading
activity of different owners, whereas order-driven measures are probably more correlated
with the adverse selection costs embedded in a stock’s ownership structure spread (Lin,
Sanger, and Boolh, 1995; Huang and Stoll, 1997; Helﬁn and Shaw, 2000; Barclay and
Hendershott, 2004). We therefore employ ten different measures of liquidity. We construct
these measures by calculating the average for a given ﬁrm in a given quarter. For measures
that are dependent on intra-day data, we follow Weston (2000) and Grullon, Kanatas, and
Weston, (2004) and ﬁlter the TAQ database. We further ﬁlter our data so that we retain
only those trades that take place during the one-hour period between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00
p.m. on any given trading day. Our focus on this one hour of trade is consistent with
McInish and Wood (1992), who ﬁnd that while time-weighted spreads tend to change
substantially across the trading day, they tend to vary less at the middle part of the trading
day. One can view our approach as taking a middle ground with regard to the appropriate
ﬁltering of intra-day observations. On the one hand, we want to have a sufﬁciently
large data set to create our measures; on the other hand, including trade data from all
hours of the trading day without modeling the time-varying properties of the liquidity
measure could be problematic. We believe that a one-hour period is both sufﬁciently long
to produce reliable measures and sufﬁciently short to safely ignore the time-varying
properties of liquidity.3
1.2.1. Volume and turnover
We construct three different measures that capture the trading activity in a given share
in a given quarter. Speciﬁcally, dollar volume is the monthly share volume times the
month’s closing price, share volume is the monthly share volume, and turnover is
the monthly share volume divided by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the
month.
1.2.2. Quoted spreads and depths
Our main measure for the bid-ask spread is the time-weighted bid-ask spread. This
measure is calculated by weighting the different relative bid-ask spreads (i.e., the ask price
minus the bid price, divided by the quote midpoint) according to the length of time that the
quote is standing (see McInish and Wood, 1992). We also use the equal-weighted bid-ask
spread, where each quote gets equal weight when averaging across the quarter. We
calculate our measure of dollar depth as the number of shares at the bid and ask multiplied
by their respective prices.
1.2.3. Effective spread and price impact measures
Following Barclay and Hendershott (2004), we employ two measures. The effective
spread is the absolute difference between the trade price and the quote midpoint at the time
of the trade divided by the quote midpoint. The realized spread is the signed (positive for
buyer-initiated and negative for seller-initiated trades) difference between the trade price
3

For a subsample of eight quarters, we recalculate the measures over the three-hour period 11:00 a.m. to 2:00
p.m. The correlation between the intraday measures (of the same type) for one hour and three hours is above 0.95.

227

and quote midpoint ﬁve minutes after the trade.4 Our principal measure of price impact
(intra-day) is the signed difference between the quote midpoint ﬁve minutes after the trade
and the quote midpoint at the time of the trade. The effective spread, realized spread, and
price impact are calculated each minute and then averaged across the quarter. Finally,
price impact (daily) is the measure developed by Amihud (2002) and later employed by
Acharya and Pedersen (2005). It is the ratio of the daily absolute return to the daily dollar
volume.
1.3. Controls
Because most of the liquidity measures above are also related to return volatility, we
control for it in the multivariate analysis. Note that since all of the liquidity measures
of the study are calculated within a given quarter, our volatility measure is also
calculated based on the daily returns in a given quarter. The other control variables that we
use are size (log of the market value of the ﬁrm’s equity), share price, and book to
market. We include size and share price as these have been shown to be correlated with
many aspects of liquidity; the role of book to market is to control for risk characteristics of
the ﬁrm.
2. Univariate analysis
2.1. Sample distribution
Table 1 reports the sample distribution properties of ownership, liquidity, and other ﬁrm
characteristics. Given that our sample consists of 1,369 of the top 2,000 ﬁrms by asset
value, these ﬁrms are predominantly widely held. The median institution holding is
approximately 60%, while the median insiders’ holding is less than 2%. The table also
shows that 75% of the ﬁrms have at least one institutional blockholder. Insider
blockholders, in contrast, are present for only a small portion of the sample; however, once
present they hold a very high percentage of the shares outstanding.
Table 1 also provides the distribution of different types of insiders. Having partitioned
manager insiders, non-manager insiders (beneﬁcial owners and board members who are
not executives), and insiders that are also ﬁnancial institutions as observed in 13F
statements, we ﬁnd that most of the insider holdings are held by beneﬁcial owners and
directors that are not employed by the ﬁrm. We also ﬁnd that there are few instances in
which institutions are also insiders.
Finally, Table 1 provides the distribution of liquidity measures. Consistent with the
literature, the table shows that the liquidity measures are highly skewed. As a result,
throughout the analysis we use the log of our liquidity measures. Our sample consists of
liquid shares: the median monthly dollar volume is close to $150 million, and the median
quoted spread is 2.25%. The mean effective spread is somewhat lower than what Barclay
and Hendershott (2004) report for their sample of NASDAQ-only shares. However, the
mean realized spread is similar in magnitude to what these authors report. Other ﬁrm

In order to classify trades to buy and sells, we follow the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm and delay quotes ﬁve
seconds relative to transactions, with adjustments for the NASDAQ market made according to Ellis, Michaely,
and O’Hara (2000).

Table 1
Sample distribution of ownership, liquidity and other ﬁrm characteristics
The sample has 1369 ﬁrms in the top 2000 ﬁrms by asset value as of 31.12.1998. All variables are calculated for each ﬁrm-quarter during the 5 year period of Q1
1999–Q4 2003. The liquidity measures are calculated as the average across the quarter. Institutional holdings is the combined holdings of all institutional investors
(calculated from 13F schedules) that have not reported themselves as insiders in forms 3 or 4 (hence, non-insiders). Institutional blockholdings is the combined
holdings of all non-insiders institutional investors that hold more than 5% of the shares outstanding. HS measure is calculated based on Hertzel and Starks (2003) and
is the combined holdings of the top ﬁve non-insiders institutional investors divided by the combined holdings of all non-insiders institutional investors. Insiders’
holdings is the combined holdings of insiders as aggregated from forms 3 and 4. Insiders blockholdings is the combined holdings of insiders that hold more than 5%
of the shares outstanding. Insiders — management is the combined holdings of insiders that are employed by the company (e.g., CEO, CFO, Controller, etc). Insiders
— no management are insiders that report themselves as either B/O (beneﬁcial owners) or as board members. Insiders — institutions are institutions that report
themselves both on 13F schedules and on form 3 or 4. Dollar volume is the monthly share volume times the month’s closing price. Share volume is the monthly share
volume. Turnover is the monthly share volume divided by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the month. Dollar depth is the number of shares at the bid
and ask multiplied by their respective prices. The equal-weighted bid/ask spread is the relative spread, where each quote update receives equal weight. Time-weighted
bid/ask quote spread is the relative spread calculated as in McInish and Wood (1992), where longer standing quotes receive higher weight. Effective spread is the
absolute difference between the trade price and the quote midpoint at the time of the trade. The realized spread is the signed (positive for buyer-initiated and negative
for seller-initiated trades) difference between the trade price and quote midpoint 5 min after the trade. Price impact (intra-day) is the signed difference between the
quote midpoint 5 min after the trade and the quote midpoint at the time of trade. The effective, realized spread and price impact (intra-day) are calculated each
minute. Price impact (daily) is based on Amihud (2000) and is calculated as abs (daily return)/(daily volume). Market value is the market value of the ﬁrm as of the
end of the quarter. Volatility is daily return volatility during the quarter. Share price is the share value of the ﬁrm’s common shares as of the end of the quarter. Book
to market is the book value of equity (Compustat item 59) divided by the market value of equity.

the median daily volatility is 2.53%, and the median share price is around $25.
2.2. Univariate analysis
Table 2 reports the average cross-sectional correlations that obtain between variables
across the 20 quarters of our study. Panel A provides correlations between pairs of
ownership variables. Note that by construction, total institutional ownership is negatively
correlated to total insiders’ holdings as the ownership pie must sum to 100%. If insiders
hold less of the ownership pie, one would typically expect to ﬁnd that institutional
investors hold a larger portion of the ownership pie. In our sample, the correlation between
the two is 0.29 and is highly signiﬁcant. With regard to liquidity this issue is important, as
almost by deﬁnition insiders trade less than institutions. Therefore, a regression that uses
insiders’ (institutional) holdings as a dependent variable but does not also include
institutional (insiders’) holdings as a dependent variable may lead to spurious results.
Moreover, note that the cross-sectional correlation between insiders’ holdings and insiders’
blockholdings is 0.98. In other words, insider ownership level and insider concentration are
highly correlated. Including both variables in a multivariate speciﬁcation would lead to
almost perfect multicolinearity. Fortunately, both the trading and adverse selection
hypotheses predict that insiders’ holdings are negatively correlated to liquidity. Thus, our
predictions are not affected by the fact that insider’ ownership level and ownership
concentration must be collapsed into one measure. Finally, it is important to note that
blockholdings are positively correlated with both institutions’ ownership level and insider’s
ownership level. Running a regression with blockholdings as the only ownership variable
may therefore be misleading.
Panel B of Table 2 presents correlations between the ten liquidity variables. We split the
panel into two horizontal segments and two vertical segments for convenience. For the ﬁrst
four liquidity variables (dollar volume, share volume, turnover, dollar depth), a high value
translates into high liquidity, while for the last six liquidity variables, a low value translates
into high liquidity. Thus, to maintain consistency across the liquidity variables, we expect
the top-left and the bottom-right segments to have positive correlations, while we expect
the bottom-left segment to have negative correlations. Panel B conﬁrms the conjecture that
all liquidity variables are correlated.5
Panel C of Table 2 provides cross-sectional correlations between major ownership and
liquidity variables. We can see from the table that institutional holdings are positively
related to all liquidity measures, namely, higher dollar volume, higher dollar depth, lower
time-weighted spread, lower effective spread, and lower price impact (intra-day). The
opposite is true with regard to insiders’ holdings, which are negatively correlated to all
measures of liquidity. Blockholdings are also negatively correlated with liquidity, but this
result is somewhat overshadowed by the magnitude of the correlation of insiders’ holdings
with liquidity. Finally, our two institutional concentration measures realize rather different
correlations with the liquidity variables. While the HS measure is highly negatively
correlated with liquidity, the correlation between institutional blockholdings and liquidity
is low. This fact may be helpful below when we conduct robustness checks in a multivariate
5

Aitken and Comerton-Forde (2003) provide evidence that different liquidity variables may provide
inconsistent inferences about liquidity.

Table 2
Cross section correlation
Panel A shows the average cross-sectional correlation between pairs of the ownership variables. Panel B shows the average cross sectional correlation between pairs
of the liquidity variables. Panel C shows the average cross sectional correlation between pairs of major liquidity and ownership variables. The average is taken over
the 20 quarters starting with Q1, 1999 through the Q4, 2003. The liquidity measures are calculated as the log of the measure after it has been averaged across the
quarter. Deﬁnitions of variables are provided in Table 1.

context as both measures should be able to quantify the incentives of institutions to trade
on information.
A conclusion that is reached from the univariate analysis is that the liquidity variables
are highly correlated. This is especially true when one considers the correlation amongst
volume-based measures, and the correlation amongst price-based measures. It is also
consistent with the ﬁndings of Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001) that show that there are
common factors in different proxies of liquidity. Given these observations and for brevity
of exposition, in what follows, we focus our analyses and present results for dollar volume,
time-weighted spread, and price impact (intra-day). These measures together represent well
the spectrum of liquidity variables, from those that mostly capture trading activity (for
example, dollar volume) to those that capture the adverse selection component of the
spread (for example, price impact (intra-day)). In the robustness portion of the paper
(Section 5) we return to the other measures to show that these results are not altered by the
type of liquidity measure used.
2.3. Time-series
As our sample covers 1369 ﬁrms over a relatively short period of 5 years, it is more
suited for analyzing the ownership–liquidity relation in the cross-section, rather than over
time. However, an analysis of the time-series properties provides for a better exposition of
the main ideas presented in this paper; therefore, in this subsection we provide a time-series
description of our data.
To get a feeling for the liquidity changes over our sample period, we construct equalweighted liquidity measures of our main dependent variables.
Fig. 3 does not reveal a time trend in the equal-weighted dollar volume and timeweighted spread measures; however, there is a signiﬁcant reduction in the equal-weighted
price impact measure over time. When we regress these measures on a time trend, the
coefﬁcient of the time trend is not signiﬁcant for the equal-weighted dollar volume and
time-weighted spread measures, but it is highly signiﬁcant for the equal-weighted price
impact measure.
One possible reason for this reduced price impact level in the later period of our sample is
decimalization. The NYSE initiated decimalization on Jan. 29, 2001, and this was quickly
followed by decimalization in Nasdaq on April 9, 2001. Thus, we may be observing a
structural break in the data rather than a time trend. When we rerun the regression of the
equal-weighted price impact measure on a time trend and a dummy variable that equals one
for quarters Q1 2001 and forward, the signiﬁcant time trend coefﬁcient becomes insigniﬁcant,
and all the explanatory power of the regression is captured by the indicator. Therefore,
throughout the cross-sectional analysis we use a decimalization dummy as a control variable.
As for ownership, over the sample period, institutional holdings increased from an
average of 49.7% in Q1 1999 to an average of 63.7% in Q4 2003 — a large change
considering the relatively short ﬁve-year period. This translates to an average increase in
institutional holdings of 1.4% every six months. Similarly, institutional blockholdings
increased from an average of 12.3% in Q1 1999 to an average of 15.0% in Q4 2003, while
insiders’ holdings decreased from 12.8% in Q1 1999 to an average of 6.1% in Q4 2003.
Thus it seems that certain trends in ownership exist. In fact, the lack of apparent trends in
equal-weighted liquidity measures may be explained by the simultaneous increase in both
institutional holdings and institutional blockholdings.

Note that as our sample includes many ﬁrms, the statistical concerns over time-variation
of the variables is small. Typically, one does not need to restrict the dynamic behavior
of the data when the number of ﬁrms in the panel is large relative to the number
of periods (see Wooldridge, 2002, p. 175).6 However, we provide a variety of speciﬁcations in the robustness portion of the paper (Section 5) to show that the qualitative
nature of our results is not altered by the nature of the econometric speciﬁcation
employed.
Part of the change in institutional level can be explained by the gradual reduction
of insider holdings. Over time, insiders tend to sell off their shares in the company.
However, we observe that many institutional holdings increases and decreases occur when
there is no apparent change in insiders’ holdings nor there is a change in institutional
concentration.
We next provide examples of how changes in institutional level and concentration occur
in our sample. During Q2 2000, Pﬁzer’s institutional holdings increased from 59.7% to
77.1%. This occurred when no changes in insiders’ holdings and institutional concentration are reported. A large change in institutional concentration occurred in Sprint
during Q1 2002. At that time, Capital Research and Management Corporation
increased its share holdings in Sprint to 10.4%, making it the largest institutional
blockholder of the company. In the same quarter, Barclays, which was the largest
institutional holder of Sprint as of Q4 2001, increased its holding in the company from
4.7% to 5.4%. These two transactions had a major effect on Sprint’s institutional
concentration. Institutional blockholdings increased from 0 to 15.8% and the HS measure
increased from 22.6% to 33.9%.
6
Also, for short panels where T (number of periods) is relatively small to N (number of ﬁrms), the tests for
stationarity developed under the assumption of large T are usually unsatisfactory because the rate condition
N/T- 0 limits the application of the tests to cases where T is larger than N (Hadri and Larsson (2005)).

3. Multivariate analysis
In this section we wish to learn how the high correlations between the different
ownership variables affect the results that correspond to different types of speciﬁcations.
As discussed previously, we show the results of this analysis for dollar volume, timeweighted spread, and price impact (intra-day), as these measures represent the spectrum of
liquidity variables.
Throughout this analysis, the model that we test is the following:
Liqi ¼ g0 þ g13 ðownership variableÞi þ g4 ðmarket valueÞi þ g5 ðshare priceÞi
þ g6 ðbook to marketÞi þ g7 ðvolatilityÞi þ g8 ðdecimalizationÞi þ i ,

ð1Þ

where the number of ownership variables differs across the analysis. We take a two-step
approach in deriving the multivariate regression speciﬁcation. In the ﬁrst step, we test
for the appropriate ownership level speciﬁcation. In the second step, we test for the
appropriate ownership concentration speciﬁcation. After deriving the desired speciﬁcation
of ownership variables, we regress this speciﬁcation on all liquidity variables. Because
one could argue that our panel ownership and liquidity variables may result in the
clustering of errors, we wish to correct for both time dependency and ﬁrm dependency. We
therefore follow Petersen (2006) and use the two-dimensional clustered standard errors
approach.7
3.1. Step 1—ownership level
Since the sum of the ownership level variables must add up to 100%, typically there is a
negative correlation between insider holdings and institutional holdings. Table 3 presents
three types of speciﬁcations for regressing ownership level on different liquidity measures.
In speciﬁcations (1), (4), and (7), the independent variable is insiders’ holdings; in
speciﬁcations (2), (5), and (8), the independent variable is institutional holdings; and in
speciﬁcations (3), (6), and (9), both insiders’ and institutional holdings are included. One
can see from the table that insiders’ holdings seem to have a negative effect on liquidity
when it is the sole ownership level variable used. In contrast, when institutional holdings
are the only ownership variable, the correlation between institutional ownership and
liquidity is positive. This is what we would expect given the negative correlation between
insiders’ holdings and institutional holdings. However; one can not infer from these two
speciﬁcations which ownership variable dominates the relation with liquidity. While it
seems that institutional holdings are more important, as the R-squared and signiﬁcance
level are higher for speciﬁcations (2), (5), and (8) compared to speciﬁcations (1), (4), and
(7), the appropriate speciﬁcation includes both ownership level variables. Certainly, this
speciﬁcation provides a better description of the ownership pie. The results in the table
indicate that when both variables are used in the regression, the institutional holdings
variable dominates. In fact, in speciﬁcation (6) the insiders’ holdings’ coefﬁcient ﬂips signs
and is signiﬁcant at the 5% level. It seems, therefore, that both institutional holdings and
insiders’ holdings are negatively correlated with the time-weighted spread. The only
negative correlation between insiders’ holdings and liquidity that persists is that with dollar
7

Our results hold in alternative speciﬁcations. These are discussed in the robustness portion of the paper
(Section 5).

Table 3
Liquidity and ownership level
Insiders’ holdings is the combined holdings of insiders as aggregated from forms 3 and 4. Institutional holdings
is the combined holdings of all institutional investors (calculated from 13F schedules) that have not reported
themselves as insiders in forms 3 or 4 (hence, non-insiders). The liquidity measures are calculated by taking the log
of the average across the quarter. Dollar volume is the monthly share volume times the month’s closing price.
Time-weighted bid/ask quote spread is the relative spread calculated as in McInish and Wood (1992), where
longer standing quotes receive higher weight. Price impact (intra-day) is calculated each minute and is deﬁned as
the signed difference between the quote midpoint 5 min after the trade and the quote midpoint at the time of trade.
Market value is the log of the market value of the ﬁrm as of the end of the quarter. Share price is the share value of
the ﬁrm’s common shares as of the end of the quarter. Book to market is the book value of equity (Compustat item
59) divided by the market value of equity. Volatility is the log of the daily return volatility during the quarter.
Decimalization is a dummy variable that equals 1 for Q1 2001–Q4 2003. The standard deviation of the coefﬁcients
is calculated with two-dimensional clustered standard errors as in Petersen (2006); t-stats of coefﬁcient are
provided in parenthesis.

volume. According to speciﬁcation (3), it appears that insiders trade less than other
individual investors, while institutional investors trade more often than other individual
investors.
Note that Table 3 also conﬁrms several regularities concerning liquidity and the other
control variables. In particular, ﬁrm market value is highly positively correlated with
liquidity and volatility is negatively correlated with liquidity when measured by timeweighted spread and price impact, but is positively correlated with liquidity when
measured by dollar volume (Anderson, 1996; Karpoff, 1987).
3.2. Step 2—ownership concentration
Table 4 presents regression results for different speciﬁcations of the ownership
concentration variables. In speciﬁcations (1), (4), and (7), total blockholdings are the

only dependent variable. According to this speciﬁcation, it seems that blockholdings are
negatively correlated with dollar volume, time-weighted spread, and price impact (intraday). Thus, it appears that blockholdings improves liquidity as measured by order-driven
liquidity measures. The main problem with this speciﬁcation is that it ignores the
ownership level variables. In speciﬁcations (2), (5), and (8), insiders’ holdings and
institutional holdings are added to the regression speciﬁcation. We can see that this
speciﬁcation changes the results for blockholdings (compared to (1), (4), and (7)), which
now is clearly negatively correlated with volatility. However, this speciﬁcation also
changes the results for insiders’ holdings obtained in Table 3, speciﬁcations (3), (6), and
(9). Insiders’ holdings, like institutional holdings, are now strongly positively correlated
with liquidity.
From our univariate analysis, we know that blockholdings are highly correlated with
insider holdings (correlation of 0.684), and thus we must take care in interpreting the
above results. We do so by partitioning blockholdings into its two major components,
institutional blockholdings and insider blockholdings. We also know that insider holdings
and insider blockholdings are almost perfectly correlated (correlation of 0.981), so
including both insiders’ holdings and insiders’ blockholdings will result in multicolinearity.

We therefore include institutional blockholdings as the only concentration measure
together with the ownership level variables. Speciﬁcations (3), (6), and (9) suggest that once
ownership level variables are included in the speciﬁcation, the marginal contribution in
blockholders comes for its institutional blockholdings portion. The coefﬁcient of
institutional blockholders in speciﬁcations (3), (6), and (9) is larger and more signiﬁcant
than the coefﬁcient of blockholdings in speciﬁcations (2), (5), and (8). Note that the
inference we draw with respect to the correlation between insiders’ holdings and liquidity is
now in line with what we ﬁnd in Table 3 (speciﬁcations (3), (6), and (9)). We feel
comfortable that this last speciﬁcation lends itself to better interpretation of the results as it
more clearly separates the important groups of shareholders as perceived by the securities
laws.
Speciﬁcations (3), (6), (9) suggest that a one standard deviation increase in institutional
holdings is associated with a 30% increase, a 35% decrease, and a 21% decrease of a
standard deviation of dollar volume, time-weighted spread, and price impact, respectively.
For institutional blockholdings increases these ﬁgures are a 14.4% decrease, a 13.8%
increase, and a 7.37% increase respectively. For insiders holdings increases these ﬁgures
are a 2.5% decrease, a 2.8% decrease, and an insigniﬁcant 0.06% decrease, respectively.
3.3. The spectrum of liquidity measures
While the results with regard to the relation between institutional ownership and
liquidity are very convincing as they are very signiﬁcant, the same can not be said about
insiders’ holdings. On the one hand, insiders’ holdings are negatively correlated with dollar
volume; on the other hand, insiders’ holdings are positively correlated with time-weighted
spread, suggesting that insider trade may increase liquidity on some dimensions. This is
somewhat problematic for two reasons. First, from a theoretical point of view, it is
counterintuitive that insider holdings would reduce spreads. Demsetz (1986) notes that
uninformed investors in ﬁrms with high insider ownership tend to adopt a buy-and-hold
strategy as they realize that they are relatively uninformed. This should lead to lower
liquidity as the market maker understands that most transactions involve informed
investors.8 Second, while for institutional ownership we have ownership level and
ownership concentration, for insider holdings we are empirically forced to use only one
measure. It is therefore harder to comprehend the overall effect of insider holdings.
To further explore this relation we make use of our spectrum of three liquidity variables.
If insiders differ only in their trading activity (and do not affect the adverse selection costs),
we should ﬁnd that insiders’ holdings do not help in explaining price impact once we
control for trading activity by employing a liquidity measure that is highly correlated with
trading. Similarly, if insiders only affect adverse selection costs (and not trading activity),
we should ﬁnd that insiders’ holdings do not help in explaining trading activity once we
control for adverse selection by employing a liquidity measure that is highly correlated
with adverse selection.
Table 5 reports results of a regression in which both the dependent variable and one of
the independent variables are liquidity measures. That is, when the dependent variable is
8
Chiang and Venkatesh (1988) ﬁnd a positive correlation between insider ownership and spreads for a small
sample of ﬁrms in 1973. In contrast, Glosten and Harris (1988) report an insigniﬁcant relation between spreads
and insiders’ holdings for a sample of 250 NYSE stocks over the 1981–1983 period.

dollar volume, we use either the time-weighted spread or price impact as our control.
When the dependent variable is price impact, we use either dollar volume or time-weighted
spread as controls. By doing so, we are able to verify whether our three ownership
structure variables are able to provide extra explanatory power on both aspects of
liquidity, i.e., trading activity and adverse selection, or whether the explanatory power is
derived through an effect on a certain liquidity dimension. For example, if insiders trade
less, they may indirectly also affect price impact; however, it would be hard to conclude
that this is due to adverse selection costs.
The results clearly show that institutional holdings and institutional concentration
provide explanatory power even when we control for other dimensions of liquidity. With
respect to insiders, we conclude that there is relatively strong evidence that insiders’
holdings are negatively correlated with trading activity, but the results concerning price
impact are not signiﬁcant.

4. Simultaneous equations
Next we consider the endogeneity that may exist in the determination of ownership
structure and liquidity. Falenstein (1996) ﬁnds that institutions prefer large, liquid stocks.
Hence, liquidity and institutional ownership may be simultaneously determined, that is, an
institutional investor’s decision to become a shareholder or a blockholder may depend on
the ﬁrm’s liquidity. To address this concern, we rely upon the work of Demsetz and Lehn
(1985), Denis and Sarin (1999), Helﬁn and Shaw (2000), and Gompers and Metrick (2001)
and add the following explanatory variables as instruments: quarterly equity return,
leverage (long-term debt divided by market value of equity), ﬁrm age (number of years
since the ﬁrm ﬁrst appears on CRSP tape), diversiﬁcation (log of the ratio of the sum of
the segments’ sales squared divided by total sales squared), and industry classiﬁcation
(two-digit SIC code).
Table 6 presents the simultaneous equation estimation of the three-step least squares; the
two-step procedure yields similar results. Note that these are Fama-McBeth regressions.
Thus, we run the simultaneous equation speciﬁcation separately for each quarter and
present the average and standard deviation of the coefﬁcients across these 20 regressions.
To facilitate comparison with other studies, we present the most commonly used measures
of liquidity, namely, the time-weighted spread and the effective spread.
In broad terms, we ﬁnd that institutional holdings are affected by a stock’s liquidity. As
can be seen in speciﬁcations (1b) and (2b), institutional holdings decrease with increases in
the time-weighted spread or the effective spread. The results with regard to institutional
blockholdings are less conclusive; in speciﬁcation (1c) the time-weighted spread has no
effect on blockholdings, while in speciﬁcation (2c) institutional blockholdings are
positively correlated with the effective spread. The rest of the results are consistent in
both speciﬁcations: institutional holdings have a positive effect on liquidity, institutional
blockholdings have a negative effect on liquidity, and insiders’ holdings have a positive
effect on some order-driven measures of liquidity.
Our regression coefﬁcients from speciﬁcations (1a) and (2a) suggest that a one standard
deviation increase in institutional holdings causes a 58% of a standard deviation reduction
in the time-weighted spread, and a 65% of a standard deviation reduction in the effective
spread. We also ﬁnd that a one standard deviation increase in institutional blockholdings
causes a 61.7% standard deviation increase in the time-weighted spread, and a 43.2% of a
standard deviation increase in the effective spread. These numerical estimates indicate that
both institutional ownership level and institutional concentration have an economically
signiﬁcant effect on liquidity.
5. Robustness
In this section we provide robustness analysis. Our aim here is merely to show that our
results with regard to institutional holdings and institutional blockholdings are robust
across different speciﬁcations. Table 7 provides regression results for our three main
dependent variables: dollar volume, time-weighed spread, and price impact (intra-day).
The speciﬁcations used throughout are those of speciﬁcation (3), (6), and (9) of Table 4;
however, the econometric analysis is different.
In speciﬁcations (1)–(3) we difference both the dependent and independent variables.
This is done for two reasons. First, we wish to mitigate any concerns about time variation

Table 6
Simultaneous equation estimation — 3SLS
Institutional blockholdings is the combined holdings of all non-insiders institutional investors that hold more
than 5% of the shares outstanding. Effective spread is the absolute difference between the trade price and the
quote midpoint at the time of the trade and is calculated each minute. The measure used in the regression is the log
of the average measure calculated across the quarter. Return is the ﬁrm’s share price return during the quarter.
Leverage is the book value of long term debt (Compustat item 9) divided by the market value of equity. Firm’s age
is the number of years since the ﬁrm’s share appears on the CRSP tape. HHI segment is the log of the ratio: sum of
the segments sales squared divided by total sales squared. The remaining variables are deﬁned in Table 3. The N
range is the range of number of ﬁrms in the 20 cross-sectional regressions. t-stats of coefﬁcient are calculated using
Fama-McBeth procedure.

Robustness of regression speciﬁcations
Speciﬁcation (1)–(3) provide regression results after differencing both dependent and independent variables.
Speciﬁcation (4)–(6) include ﬁrm and time ﬁxed-effects. Speciﬁcations (7)–(9) provide signiﬁcance of coefﬁcient
when each cross-sectional regression in a given quarter is run separately. Institutional blockholdings is the
combined holdings of all non-insiders institutional investors that hold more than 5% of the shares outstanding.
The remaining variables are deﬁned in Table 3. For speciﬁcation (1)–(3), the standard deviation of the coefﬁcients
is calculated with two-dimensional clustered standard errors as in Petersen (2006). For speciﬁcation (4)–(9), the
standard errors are calculated with White-corrected standard errors.

violations of the dependent or independent variables. Second, it is interesting to see
whether the relation observed on the levels, also holds when we study changes. If a relation
holds also for changes, then that would mean that ownership changes are impounded in
liquidity almost immediately; while if the relation does not hold, we could only argue that
in the long term there is a relation between ownership level and liquidity. As can be seen in
speciﬁcations (1)–(3) the relation of institutional holdings and institutional block holdings
persists; however, the effect of changes of insiders’ holdings is not signiﬁcant in two out of
the three speciﬁcations. In fact, insiders’ holdings increases seem to be positively correlated
with price impact, something that is not revealed when studying the level variables.
In speciﬁcations (4)–(6), we present ﬁrm and time ﬁxed-effect regression. The purpose is
to provide another veriﬁcation of our results. By nature, ﬁrm ﬁxed-effects rely on the time
variation within a given ﬁrm, and the cross-sectional variation plays a minor role in these

243

speciﬁcations. The results persist with regard to institutional holdings and institutional
concentration.
Finally, speciﬁcations (7)–(9) show whether the coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant when we regress
each cross-sectional regression (in a given quarter) separately. The numbers presented in
each cell are four, two of which are in parenthesis. A positive (negative) sign followed by a
number represents the number of regressions (out of 20) for which the coefﬁcient is positive
(negative) and signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Similarly coded, the numbers in parentheses
represent coefﬁcients which are signiﬁcant at the 5% level. In this speciﬁcation again, we can
see that the correlation of institutional holdings and institutional concentration are strongly
signiﬁcant with the same signs as before. As for insiders, it seems that they trade less often,
but their effect on price-based liquidity measures is not very signiﬁcant.
Another test, which we conduct in Table 8, is to include an interaction term between
institutional level and institutional concentration. In speciﬁcations (1) and (2), we include
an interaction term between institutional holdings and the HS measure to check if the
marginal effect of one decreases in the other.9 We note that for the time-weighted spread,
the effect of the interaction term is insigniﬁcant, while for the price-impact measure it is
negative and signiﬁcant. Moreover, in speciﬁcation (2) the inclusion of the interaction term
eliminates the institutional holdings coefﬁcient signiﬁcance. This suggests that institutional
concentration may be somewhat more important than institutional holdings if one
considers the price-impact measure.
So far we have focused our analyses on only three liquidity variables. In speciﬁcations
(3)–(9) of Table 8, we present results for all the other liquidity variables used in the study.
We also arbitrarily choose either the HS measure or the institutional blockholdings to
show that both measures yield similar results even though their correlations with the
ownership level variables are different.
Speciﬁcations (3)–(9) are consistent with previous results. We ﬁnd that institutional
holdings are positively correlated with liquidity, while institutional concentration is
negatively correlated with liquidity. Moreover, the correlation of insiders’ holdings with
liquidity is negative for trade-based measures such as volume, turnover, and depth, but
tends to be either insigniﬁcant or somewhat positive for order-driven measures such as the
quoted spread and the realized spread. The positive correlation that insiders’ holdings have
on the price impact (daily) measure is not surprising, given that the latter is probably more
related to volume-based measures than price-based measures.
We next conduct a simple event study whose purpose is to see how ownership changes
lead to changes in liquidity. To eliminate contemporaneous changes in different ownership
dimensions, we analyze extreme changes in one ownership variable when other ownership
variables changes are small. For example, an extreme change in institutional holdings
would be deﬁned as one in which there is a large change in institutional holdings in a given
ﬁrm-quarter at a time in which insiders’ holdings and the HS measure change for that ﬁrm
are relatively small. Similarly we study extreme changes in the HS measure (insiders’
holdings) when institutional holdings and insiders’ holdings (HS measure) changes are
9
The correlation between institutional blockholdings and the interaction term institutional blockholdings 
institutional holdings is 0.964, while the correlation between the HS measure and the interaction term of the HS
measure  institutional holdings is 0.127. The correlations of these two interaction terms with institutional
holdings are 0.669 and 0.714 respectively. Therefore, to mitigate the problem of deriving inference from highly
correlated dependent variables, the interaction term of institutional holdings with the HS measure is used.

Table 8
Liquidity and ownership structure
Institutional blockholdings is the combined holdings of all non-insiders institutional investors that hold more
than 5% of the shares outstanding. HS measure is calculated based on Hertzell and Starks (2003) and is the
combined holdings of the top ﬁve non-insiders institutional investors divided by the combined holdings of all noninsiders institutional investors. The liquidity measures are calculated by taking the log of the average across the
quarter. Share volume is the monthly share volume. Turnover is the monthly share volume divided by the number
of shares outstanding at the end of the month. Dollar depth is the number of shares at the bid and ask multiplied
by their respective prices. The equal-weighted bid/ask spread is the relative spread, where each quote update
receives equal weight. The effective spread is the absolute difference between the trade price and the quote
midpoint at the time of the trade. The realized spread is the signed (positive for buyer-initiated and negative for
seller-initiated trades) difference between the trade price and quote midpoint 5 min after the trade. The effective
and realized spreads are calculated each minute. Price impact (daily) is based on Amihud (2000) and is calculated
as abs(daily return)/(daily volume). The remaining variables are deﬁned in Table 3. The standard deviation of the
coefﬁcients is calculated with two-dimensional clustered standard errors as in Petersen (2006); t-stats of coefﬁcient
are provided in parenthesis.

relatively small.10 In particular, a change in institutional holdings would be deﬁned by
applying the following steps:
10
We choose the HS measure for this rather than institutional blockholdings as it is a more continuous measure.
Institutional blockholdings tend to jump when an institutional blockholder reduces (increases) ownership below
(above) the 5% level.

(i) we ﬁrst winsorize the sample and keep only observations for which the change in
insiders’ holdings and the change in the HS measure are in the range of 25–75%
percentile of their respective empirical distribution (e.g., as can be learned from
Table 9 Panel A, for insiders’ holdings that would translate to a change range of
0.03–0.04%);
(ii) we then deﬁne an extreme increase as that where institutional holdings changes by
more than the 90% percentile value of its empirical distribution in the winsorized
sample. Similarly we deﬁne an extreme decrease as that where institutional holdings
changes by less than the 10% percentile value of its empirical distribution in the
winsorized sample.
This approach was respectively applied for extreme changes in insiders’ holdings and
institutional concentration.
Table 9 provides difference of means and median tests on changes in the liquidity
measures following such changes in ownership. Overall, we ﬁnd that institutional level
increases tend to increase liquidity (though, this result is not signiﬁcant for the price impact
measure), while increases in institutional concentration tend to reduce liquidity. The effect
of changes in insiders’ holdings is not signiﬁcant in explaining changes in liquidity.
Finally, note that another way to check for the insider–liquidity relation is to partition
insider holdings along the management versus non-management dimension (see the sample
distribution in Table 1). Accordingly, we run a speciﬁcation (not reported but available
from authors upon request) in which we partition these two groups of insiders and ﬁnd
that the coefﬁcients of both groups are not signiﬁcantly correlated with liquidity. We
suspect that the strict reporting laws of the SEC and the legal liabilities that all insiders are
subject to substantially reduce trading on information by insiders.
Summarizing our results, we ﬁnd that liquidity is positively correlated with institutional
ownership level and negatively correlated with institutional concentration. We ﬁnd that
insider holdings tend to be negatively correlated with trade-based measures, but ﬁnd no
evidence that insider holdings contribute to adverse selection costs, as insiders’ holdings
coefﬁcient tends to be either insigniﬁcant or negatively correlated with various measures of
spreads. We interpret these results as evidence in support of both the trading hypothesis
and the adverse selection hypothesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that
institutions turn over their portfolios more often than insiders and other investors;
however, if institutional holdings are concentrated in a few large blockholders, market
makers perceive them as being in an inferior informational position, which results in lower
liquidity.
6. Conclusion
In this paper we conduct an extensive empirical study on the ownership-liquidity
relation of US-traded shares. By constructing high-resolution ownership data that cover 20
quarters, we conduct a step-by-step analysis to determine the nature of the ownershipliquidity relation. We ﬁnd there is a two-sided relation between institutional ownership and
liquidity. On the one hand, liquidity tends to increase with institutional ownership levels;
on the other hand, liquidity tends to decrease with institutional concentration. We also
ﬁnd that insider ownership is negatively correlated with trade-driven measures of liquidity,
but is positively correlated with some order-driven measures of liquidity. Overall, the

qualitative results with regard to institutional holdings and concentration are robust and
suggest that liquidity is mainly determined by the ownership structure of institutional
investors.
An interesting implication of the results presented in this paper is that if ownership
levels and concentration affect liquidity, then ﬁrms may optimally choose both ownership
levels and concentration when considering the optimal capital structure. For choosing
ownership optimally, one must bear in mind that (at least theoretically) institutional
blockholdings do not only entail cost, but may also provide beneﬁts by reducing the
managerial agency conﬂict. As the results of this paper suggest, there are real costs from

institutional concentration; however, there is also some evidence that institutional
blockholdings create value by creating better governance (Hetzell and Starks, 2003).
While the institutional level–liquidity relation is probably driven by their increased
trading activity compared to other shareholders, the results with regard to concentration
do not provide for a clear understanding of the relevance of trading versus adverse
selection. It is not clear how much of the negative correlation between institutional
blockholdings and liquidity is due to reduced trading activity of blockholders and how
much is due to their superior information. A better understanding of the effect of
asymmetric information versus trading activity is important if one wants to shed light on
the ways in which ﬁrms with different ownership structures can increase liquidity. For
example, Hong and Huang (2005) present a model where insiders, who typically care about
liquidity more than dispersed shareholders, may tend to over-invest in investor relation in
order to increase liquidity. However, without a clear understanding of the importance of
adverse selection, it would be hard to know the effectiveness of such activities so long as
institutional blockholdings are not reduced.
