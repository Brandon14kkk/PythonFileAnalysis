Abstract
The value of tax shields is the difference between the present values of two different cash
ﬂows, each with their own risk: the present value of taxes for the unlevered company and the
present value of taxes for the levered company. For constant growth companies, the value of
tax shields in a world with no leverage cost is the present value of the debt, times the tax rate,
times the unlevered cost of equity, discounted at the unlevered cost of equity. This result arises
as the difference of two present values and does not mean that the appropriate discount for tax
shields is the unlevered cost of equity.

1. Introduction
There is no consensus in the existing literature regarding the correct way to
compute the value of tax shields. Most authors think of calculating the value of the
tax shield in terms of the appropriate present value of the tax savings due to interest
payments on debt, but Myers (1974) proposes to discount the tax savings at the cost

of debt, whereas Harris and Pringle (1985) propose discounting these tax savings at
the cost of capital for the unlevered ﬁrm. Reﬂecting this lack of consensus, Copeland
et al. (2000, p. 482) claim that ‘‘the ﬁnance literature does not provide a clear answer
about which discount rate for the tax beneﬁt of interest is theoretically correct.’’ In
this paper, I show that a consistent way to estimate the value of the tax savings is not
by thinking of them as the present value of a set of cash ﬂows, but as the difference
between the present values of two different sets of cash ﬂows: ﬂows to the unlevered
ﬁrm and ﬂows to the levered ﬁrm.
I show that the value of tax shields for perpetuities is equal to the tax rate times the
value of debt. For constant growth companies, the value of tax shields in a world
with no leverage costs is the present value of the debt times the tax rate times the
required return to the unlevered equity, discounted at the unlevered cost of equity
ðKu Þ: This does not mean that the appropriate discount for tax shields is the
unlevered cost of equity, since the amount being discounted is higher than the tax
shield (it is multiplied by the unlevered cost of equity and not the cost of debt).
Rather, this result arises as the difference between two present values. The paper also
shows that some commonly used methodologies for calculating the value of tax
shields, including Harris and Pringle (1985), Miles and Ezzell (1980), Myers (1974),
and Ruback (2002), are incorrect for growing perpetuities.
One could argue that working out the present value of the tax shields themselves
would not necessarily be wrong, provided the appropriate discount rate were used
(reﬂecting the riskiness of the tax shields). The problem here is that the riskiness of
the tax shields is hard to evaluate because it represents the difference in the present
value of two ﬂows with different risk: the taxes paid by the unlevered company and
those paid by the levered company. In this context, evaluating the riskiness of tax
shields for a ﬁrm is conceptually as hard as evaluating the riskiness of the difference
between Microsoft’s expected equity cash ﬂows and GE’s expected equity cash ﬂows.
We can evaluate the riskiness of the expected equity cash ﬂows of each company, but
it is difﬁcult (and hardly makes any sense) to try to evaluate the riskiness of the
difference between two expected equity cash ﬂows.
Perhaps the most important issue to take into account when reading this paper is
that the term ‘‘discounted value of tax shields’’ in itself is senseless. The value of tax
shields is the difference between the present values of two separate cash ﬂows each
with its own risk.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 follows a new method to prove that
the value of tax shields for perpetuities in a world without leverage costs is equal to
the tax rate times the value of debt (DT). Section 3 derives the relation between the
required return on assets and the required return on equity for perpetuities in a world
without leverage costs. The corresponding relation between the beta of the levered
equity, the beta of the unlevered equity, and the beta of debt is also derived. Section
4 proves that the value of tax shields in a world with no leverage costs is the present
value of the debt times the tax rate times the required return to the unlevered equity,
discounted at the unlevered cost of equity. Section 5 revises and analyzes the existing
ﬁnancial literature on the value of tax shields. Most of the existing approaches,
including Harris and Pringle (1985), Miles and Ezzell (1980), Myers (1974), and

Ruback (2002) result in either inconsistent results regarding the cost of equity to the
levered and unlevered ﬁrm or estimated tax shields that are too low. Section 6
contains a numerical example for a hypothetical ﬁrm to clarify the previous sections.
Finally, Section 7 concludes.

2. The value of tax shields for perpetuities in a world without leverage costs
The value of tax shields for a perpetuity is DT; where D indicates the value of the
debt today and T is the tax rate.
The value of debt ðDÞ plus that of the equity ðEÞ of the levered company is equal to
the value of the unlevered company ðVu Þ plus VTS, the value of tax shields due to
interest payments
E þ D ¼ Vu þ VTS:

ð1Þ

In the literature, the value of tax shields deﬁnes the increase in the company’s value
as a result of the tax saving obtained by the payment of interest. In this deﬁnition,
the total value of the levered company is equal to the total value of the unlevered
company. If leverage costs do not exist, then Eq. (1) could be stated as follows:
Vu þ Gu ¼ E þ D þ GL ;

ð2Þ

where Gu is the present value of the taxes paid by the unlevered company and GL is
the present value of the taxes paid by the levered company. Eq. (2) means that the
total value of the unlevered company (left-hand side of the equation) is equal to the
total value of the levered company (right-hand side of the equation). Total value is
the enterprise value (often called the value of the ﬁrm) plus the present value of taxes.
Please note that Eq. (2) assumes that expected free cash ﬂows are independent of
leverage. When leverage costs do exist, the total value of the levered company is
lower than the total value of the unlevered company. A world with leverage cost is
characterized by the following relation:
Vu þ Gu ¼ E þ D þ GL þ Leverage Cost > E þ D þ GL :

ð3Þ

Leverage cost is the reduction in the company’s value due to the use of debt.
From (1) and (2), it is clear that VTS is
VTS ¼ Gu  GL :

ð4Þ

Note that the value of tax shields is not the present value (PV) of tax shields. It is the
difference between the PVs of two ﬂows with different risk: the PV of the taxes
paid by the unlevered company ðGu Þ and the PV of the taxes paid by the levered
company ðGL Þ:
It is quite easy to prove that, in perpetuity, the proﬁt after tax of the levered
company ðPATL Þ is equal to the equity cash ﬂow (ECF):
PATL ¼ ECF:

ð5Þ

This is so because the allowed depreciation deduction is exactly equal to the cash
actually spent to replace capital equipment that wears out.

ARTICLE IN PRESS

In a perpetuity, then, the free cash ﬂow (FCF) is equal to the proﬁt before tax of
the unlevered company ðPBTu Þ multiplied by one minus the effective tax rate:
FCF ¼ PBTu ð1  TÞ:

ð6Þ

We will call FCF0 the company’s free cash ﬂow if there were no taxes. FCF0 is
equal to the proﬁt before taxes of the unlevered company ðPBTu Þ:
FCF0 ¼ PBTu :

ð7Þ

From (6) and (7) it is clear that the relation between after-tax free cash ﬂow and the
company’s free cash ﬂow if there were no taxes is
FCF ¼ FCF0 ð1  TÞ:

ð8Þ

The taxes paid every year by the unlevered company ðTaxesU Þ are
TaxesU ¼ T PBTu ¼ T FCF0 ¼ T FCF=ð1  TÞ:

ð9Þ

Designate KTU as the required return to tax in the unlevered company, and KTL as
the required return to tax in the levered company. The taxes paid by the unlevered
company are proportional to FCF0 and FCF. Consequently, the taxes of the
unlevered company have the same risk as FCF0 (and FCF), and hence must be
discounted at the rate Ku (the required return to unlevered equity). In the unlevered
company, the required return to tax ðKTU Þ is equal to the required return to equity
ðKu Þ: This is only true for perpetuities.
KTU ¼ Ku :

ð10Þ

The present value of the taxes paid by the unlevered company ðGu Þ is the present
value of the taxes paid every year ðTaxesU Þ discounted at the appropriate discount
rate ðKu Þ: As Vu ¼ FCF=Ku ;
Gu ¼ TaxesU =KTU ¼ T FCF=½ð1  TÞKu  ¼ T Vu =ð1  TÞ:

ð11Þ

For the levered company, taking into consideration Eq. (5), the taxes paid each
year ðTaxesL Þ are proportional to the equity cash ﬂow (ECF):
TaxesL ¼ T PBTL ¼ T PATL =ð1  TÞ ¼ T ECF=ð1  TÞ:

ð12Þ

PBTL and PATL are the proﬁt before and after tax of the levered company.
Because taxes paid by the levered company are proportional to ECF, they have the
same risk as the ECF and thus must be discounted at the rate Ke : So, in the case of
perpetuities, the tax risk is identical to the equity cash ﬂow risk, and the required
return to tax in the levered company ðKTL Þ is equal to the required return to equity
ðKe Þ: Again, this is only true for perpetuities.
KTL ¼ Ke :

ð13Þ

The relation between proﬁt after tax (PAT) and proﬁt before tax (PBT) is PAT ¼
PBTð1  TÞ: Then the present value of the taxes paid by the levered company is
equal to:
GL ¼ TaxesL =KTL ¼ T ECF=½ð1  TÞKe  ¼ T E=ð1  TÞ:

ð14Þ

ARTICLE IN PRESS

149

The increase in the company’s value due to the use of debt is not the present value
of tax shields due to interest payments, but rather the difference between Gu and GL ;
which are the present values of two cash ﬂows with different risks
VTS ¼ Gu  GL ¼ ½T=ð1  TÞðVu  EÞ:

ð15Þ

Because Vu  E ¼ D  VTS; we have
VTS ¼ Value of tax shields ¼ DT:

ð16Þ

This result is far from being a new idea. Brealey and Myers (2000), Modigliani and
Miller (1963), Taggart (1991), and Copeland et al. (2000), and many others report it.
However, the way of deriving it is new. Most of these papers reach this result by
arguing that the appropriate way of computing the value of the tax shield is to
consider a certain ﬂow DT multiplied by some measure of cost of funds, a; and then
discounting that ﬂow at the same rate a: At ﬁrst glance, a could be anything, related
or unrelated to the company that we are valuing. Modigliani and Miller (1963) argue
that a is the risk-free rate ðRF Þ: Myers (1974) assumes that a is the cost of debt ðKd Þ
and says that the value of tax shields is the present value of the tax savings ðDKd TÞ
discounted at the cost of debt ðKd Þ: I represent the value of tax shields as the
difference between Gu and GL ; which are the present values of two cash ﬂows with
different risks: the taxes paid by the unlevered company and the taxes paid by the
levered company. In Section 4, I prove that the correct a is the required return to
unlevered equity ðKu Þ:
Eq. (16) is the difference between the present value of the taxes of the unlevered
company, PV½Ku ; TaxesU ; and the present value of the taxes of the levered company,
PV½Ke ; TaxesL :
VTS ¼ PV½Ku ; TaxesU   PV½Ke ; TaxesL :

ð17Þ

The annual difference between the cash ﬂows to investors in a leveraged ﬁrm
and the cash ﬂows to investors in an all-equity ﬁrm is precisely equal to the interest
tax shield
TaxesU  TaxesL ¼ DKd T:

ð18Þ

For perpetuities, and only for perpetuities, it can be argued that the risk of this
difference is Kd : Therefore, the present value of this difference should be
DKd T=Kd ¼ DT : But for growing companies, the risk of the interest tax shield is
not Kd or Ku ; as will be seen in Section 4.

3. Relation between the required return to assets ðKu Þ and the required return to equity
ðKe Þ
Knowing the value of tax shields in a perpetuity ðDTÞ; and considering that
Vu ¼ FCF=Ku ; we can rewrite Eq. (1) as follows:
E þ Dð1  TÞ ¼ FCF=Ku :

ð19Þ

ARTICLE IN PRESS
150

P. Fernandez / Journal of Financial Economics 73 (2004) 145–165

Taking into consideration that the relation between ECF and FCF for perpetuities
is
FCF ¼ ECF þ DKd ð1  TÞ

ð20Þ

and that E ¼ ECF=Ke ; we ﬁnd that the relation between the required return to assets
ðKu Þ and the required return to equity ðKe Þ in a world without leverage costs is
Ke ¼ Ku þ ðKu  Kd ÞDð1  TÞ=E:

ð21Þ

This relation can also be expressed in terms of the systematic risk of each cash
ﬂow, i.e., the betas. The formulas relating the betas with the required returns are
Ke ¼ RF þ bL PM ;

Ku ¼ RF þ bu PM ;

Kd ¼ RF þ bd PM :

RF is the risk-free rate and PM is the market risk premium. The relation between
the beta of the levered equity ðbL Þ; the beta of the unlevered equity ðbu Þ; and the beta
of debt ðbd Þ is
bL ¼ bu þ ðbu  bd ÞDð1  TÞ=E:

ð22Þ

4. The value of tax shields for growing perpetuities
For growing perpetuities, we can calculate the value of taxes for the unlevered and
levered ﬁrm. In the unlevered company with constant growth, the relation between
taxes and free cash ﬂow is different from Eq. (9), obtained for perpetuities:
TaxesU ¼ TPBTu ¼ T½FCF þ gðWCR þ NFAÞ=ð1  TÞ
¼ T½FCF þ gðEbv þ DÞ=ð1  TÞ;

ð23Þ

where WCR represents net working capital requirements, NFA is net ﬁxed assets,
Ebv is the equity book value, and g is the constant growth rate. For any company,
WCR þ NFA ¼ Ebv þ D:
From Eq. (23) we cannot establish any clear relation between the required return
to taxes and the required return to assets ðKu Þ as we had done for perpetuities in
Eq. (9) since taxes are no longer proportional to free cash ﬂow.
Similarly, in the levered company with constant growth, the relation between taxes
and equity cash ﬂow is different from Eq. (12) for perpetuities:
TaxesL ¼ TðECF þ gEbv Þ=ð1  TÞ:

ð24Þ

Again, a clear relation cannot be established between the required return to taxes
and the required return to equity as for perpetuities in Eq. (12).
A derivation analogous to the one done in Section 2 for a perpetuity could be done
for a growing ﬁrm in the extreme situation in which the ﬁrm is all-debt ﬁnanced. In
this situation, ECF ¼ E ¼ 0; and all the risk of the assets is borne by the debt
ðKd ¼ Ku Þ: In a growing perpetuity, the debt cash ﬂow is DKd  gD: As ECF ¼ 0;
and Kd ¼ Ku ; free cash ﬂow in Eq. (24) is FCF ¼ DKd ð1  TÞ  gD: The debt cash
ﬂow is DKu  gD ¼ FCF þ DTKu :

ARTICLE IN PRESS
P. Fernandez / Journal of Financial Economics 73 (2004) 145–165

151

If the ﬁrm is all-debt ﬁnanced, Ebv ¼ 0: In this situation, Eq. (23) is transformed
into
TaxesU ¼ T½FCF þ gðEbv þ DÞ=ð1  TÞ
¼ T½DðKu  gÞ  DTKu þ gDÞ=ð1  TÞ ¼ DTKu

ð25Þ

and Eq. (24) is transformed into
TaxesL ¼ TðECF þ gEbv Þ=ð1  TÞ ¼ 0:

ð26Þ

The appropriate discount rate for the taxes of the unlevered company is Ku because
the unlevered taxes are proportional to the interest rate payments (in this case DKu ).
Then Eq. (17) is transformed into
VTS ¼ Gu  GL ¼ ½TaxesU =ðKTU  gÞ  ½TaxesL =ðKTL  gÞ
¼ DTKu =ðKu  gÞ:

ð27Þ

Once again, the value of tax shields is not the present value of tax shields due to
the payment of interest but rather the difference between Gu and GL ; which represent
the present values of two cash ﬂows with different risk. The appropriate way to do an
adjusted present value analysis with a growing perpetuity is to calculate the VTS as
the present value of DTKu (not the interest tax shield) discounted at the unlevered
cost of equity ðKu Þ:
VTS ¼ PV½Ku ; DTKu :

ð28Þ

This result can be derived for the general case by noticing that the relation between
the equity cash ﬂow of the unlevered ﬁrm and the free cash ﬂow in a company with
an expected growth rate of g is
Vu ¼ FCF=ðKu  gÞ:

ð29Þ

By substituting (29) into (1), we get
E þ D ¼ FCF=ðKu  gÞ þ VTS:

ð30Þ

The relation between the equity cash ﬂow and the free cash ﬂow is
FCF ¼ ECF þ DKd ð1  TÞ  gD:

ð31Þ

By substituting (31) into (30), we get
E þ D ¼ ½ECF þ DKd ð1  TÞ  gD=ðKu  gÞ þ VTS:

ð32Þ

As ECF ¼ EðKe  gÞ; (32) can be rewritten as
E þ D ¼ ½EðKe  gÞ þ DKd ð1  TÞ  gD=ðKu  gÞ þ VTS:

ð33Þ

Multiplying both sides of Eq. (33) by ðKu  gÞ; we get
ðE þ DÞðKu  gÞ ¼ ½EðKe  gÞ þ DKd ð1  TÞ  gD þ VTSðKu  gÞ:

ð34Þ

Eliminating gðE þ DÞ on both sides of Eq. (34), we have
ðE þ DÞKu ¼ ½EKe þ DKd ð1  TÞ þ VTSðKu  gÞ:

ð35Þ

ARTICLE IN PRESS
152

P. Fernandez / Journal of Financial Economics 73 (2004) 145–165

Eq. (35) can be rewritten as
D½Ku  Kd ð1  TÞ  EðKe  Ku Þ ¼ VTSðKu  gÞ:

ð36Þ

Dividing both sides of Eq. (36) by D (debt value), we get,
½Ku  Kd ð1  TÞ  ðE=DÞðKe  Ku Þ ¼ ðVTS=DÞðKu  gÞ:

ð37Þ

If ðE=DÞ is constant, the left-hand side of Eq. (36) does not depend on growth ðgÞ
because for any growth rate ðE=DÞ; Ku ; Kd ; and Ke are constant. We know from
Eq. (16) that for g ¼ 0; VTS ¼ DT: Then Eq. (37) applied to perpetuities ðg ¼ 0Þ is
½Ku  Kd ð1  TÞ  ðE=DÞðKe  Ku Þ ¼ TKu :

ð38Þ

Subtracting (38) from (37), we get
0 ¼ ðVTS=DÞðKu  gÞ  TKu : Solving for the present value of tax shields, we get
VTS ¼ DTKu =ðKu  gÞ:

ð280 Þ

By substituting (28) into (35), we get Eq. (21). This implies that Eq. (21), which
relates the cost of capital for the levered and unlevered ﬁrm, also applies to growing
perpetuities. In fact, Eq. (21) also applies to the general case of any type of growth of
the ﬁrm.
An alternative way of deducing Eq. (28) is by noticing that Eq. (36) has to hold
true when the company is all-debt ﬁnanced, that is, when E ¼ 0 and ECF ¼ 0 (the
equity cash ﬂow is zero). In this extreme situation, all the risk of the assets is borne
by the debt ðKd ¼ Ku Þ; and Eq. (36) is
D½Ku  Ku ð1  TÞ ¼ VTSðKu  gÞ:

ð39Þ

Note that (39) is exactly the same as Eq. (28).
Eq. (28) is valid if the cost of debt ðrÞ is equal to the required return to debt ðKd Þ:
In this situation, the value of the debt ðDÞ is equal to the nominal or book value of
the debt ðNÞ: When the value of the debt ðDÞ is not equal to the nominal or book
value of the debt ðNÞ; Eq. (28) changes into
VTS ¼ ½DTKu þ TðNr  DKd Þ=ðKu  gÞ:

ð40Þ

5. Comparison to alternative measures
There is a considerable body of literature on the discounted cash ﬂow valuation of
ﬁrms. This section addresses the most salient papers, concentrating particularly on
those papers that propose alternative expressions for the value of tax shields (VTS).
The main difference between all of these papers and the approach proposed above is
that most previous papers calculate the value of tax shields as the present value of the
tax savings due to the payment of interest. Instead, the correct measure of the value
of tax shields is the difference between two present values: the present value of taxes
paid by the unlevered ﬁrm and the present value of taxes paid by the levered ﬁrm. We
will show how these proposed methods result in inconsistent valuations of the tax

shield or an inconsistent relation between the cost of capital of the unlevered and
levered ﬁrm.
Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) study the effect of leverage on ﬁrm value.
Their famous Proposition 1 states that, in the absence of taxes, the ﬁrm’s value is
independent of its debt, i.e., E þ D ¼ Vu ; if T ¼ 0: In the presence of taxes and for
the case of a perpetuity, but with zero risk of bankruptcy, they calculate the value of
tax shields by discounting the present value of the tax savings due to interest
payments on risk-free debt at the risk-free rate ðRF Þ; i.e., VTS ¼ PV½RF ; DTRF  ¼
DT: As indicated above, this result is the same as our Eq. (16) for the case of
perpetuities, but it is neither correct nor applicable for growing perpetuities.
Modigliani and Miller explicitly ignore the issue of the riskiness of the cash ﬂows by
assuming that the probability of bankruptcy was always zero.
Myers (1974) introduces the APV (adjusted present value) method in which the
value of the levered ﬁrm is equal to the value of the ﬁrm with no debt plus the present
value of the tax savings due to the payment of interest. Myers proposes calculating the
VTS by discounting the tax savings ðDTKd Þ at the cost of debt ðKd Þ: The argument is
that the risk of the tax savings arising from the use of debt is the same as the risk of the
debt. The value of tax shields is VTS ¼ PV½Kd ; DTKd : This approach has also been
recommended in later papers in the literature, such as Luehrman (1997).
Harris and Pringle (1985) propose that the present value of the tax savings due to
the payment of interest should be calculated by discounting the interest tax savings
ðKd TDÞ at the required return to unlevered equity ðKu Þ; i.e., VTS ¼ PV½Ku ; DKd T:
Their argument is that the interest tax shields have the same systematic risk as the
ﬁrm’s underlying cash ﬂows and, therefore, should be discounted at the required
return to assets ðKu Þ: Furthermore, Harris and Pringle believe that ‘‘the MM position
is considered too extreme by some because it implies that interest tax shields are no
more risky than the interest payments themselves’’ (p. 242). Ruback (1995, 2002),
Kaplan and Ruback (1995), Brealey and Myers (2000, p. 555), and Tham and Ve! lezPareja (2001), this last paper following an arbitrage argument, also claim that the
appropriate discount rate for tax shields is Ku ; the required return to unlevered equity.
Ruback (2002) presents the Capital Cash Flow (CCF) method and claims that the
appropriate discount rate is Ku ; Arditti and Levy (1977) suggested that the ﬁrm’s
value could be calculated by discounting the capital cash ﬂows instead of the free
cash ﬂow. The capital cash ﬂows are the cash ﬂows available for all holders of the
company’s securities, whether debt or equity, and are equivalent to the equity cash
ﬂows plus the cash ﬂows corresponding to the debt holders. The capital cash ﬂow is
also equal to the free cash ﬂow plus the interest tax shield ðDKd TÞ: According to the
capital cash ﬂow (CCF) method, the value of the debt today ðDÞ plus that of
the shareholders’ equity ðEÞ is equal to the capital cash ﬂow (CCF) discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital before tax ðWACCBT Þ:
E þ D ¼ PV½WACCBT ; CCF:

ð41Þ

The deﬁnition of WACCBT is
WACCBT ¼ ðEKe þ DKd Þ=ðE þ DÞ

ð42Þ

ARTICLE IN PRESS

because (42) is the discount rate that ensures that the value of the company obtained
using the following two expressions is the same:
PV½WACCBT ; CCF ¼ PV½WACC; FCF:

ð43Þ

But Ruback (1995, 2002) assumes that WACCBT ¼ Ku : With this assumption,
Ruback gets the same valuation as Harris and Pringle (1985) because
E þ D ¼ PV½Ku ; CCF ¼ PV½Ku ; FCF þ PV½Ku ; DKd T
¼ Vu þ PV½Ku ; DKd T:

ð44Þ

Note that PV½Ku ; DKd T is the VTS according to Harris and Pringle (1985).
Ruback (2002, p. 91) also shows that the relation between the beta of the levered
equity ðbL Þ; the beta of the unlevered equity ðbu Þ; and the beta of debt ðbd Þ consistent
with (44) is
bL ¼ bu þ ðbu  bd ÞD=E:

ð45Þ

Therefore, all of Ruback’s results (the relation between bL and bu using no taxes,
and Ku being the appropriate discount rate for capital cash ﬂows) come from his
method of estimating VTS, which is the same as that of Harris and Pringle.
The enterprise value ðE þ DÞ according to my proposed method is
E þ D ¼ Vu þ PV½Ku ; DKu T ¼ PV½Ku ; FCF þ DKu T:

ð46Þ

The difference between this method and Ruback’s is PV½Ku ; DðKu  Kd ÞT:
A large part of the literature argues that the value of tax shields should be
calculated in a different manner depending on the debt strategy of the ﬁrm. A ﬁrm
that wishes to keep a constant D=E ratio must be valued in a different manner from
a ﬁrm that has a preset level of debt. Miles and Ezzell (1980) indicate that for a ﬁrm
with a ﬁxed debt target (i.e., a constant ½D=ðD þ EÞ ratio), the correct rate for
discounting the tax savings due to debt is Kd for the ﬁrst year and Ku for the tax
savings in later years. Lewellen and Emery (1986) also claim that this one is the most
logically consistent method. Although Miles and Ezzell do not mention what the
value of tax shields should be, this can be inferred from their equation relating the
required return to equity with the required return for the unlevered company in
Eq. (22) in their paper. This relation implies that VTS ¼ PV½Ku ; DTKd ð1 þ Ku Þ=ð1 þ
Kd Þ: Inselbag and Kaufold (1997), and Ruback (2002) argue that if the ﬁrm targets
the dollar values of debt outstanding, the VTS is given by the Myers (1974) formula.
However, if the ﬁrm targets a constant debt/value ratio, the value of the tax shields
should be calculated according to Miles and Ezzell (1980). Finally, Taggart (1991)
proposes to use Miles and Ezzell (1980) if the company adjusts to its target debt ratio
once a year and Harris and Pringle (1985) when the company continuously adjusts to
its target debt ratio.
Damodaran (1994, p. 31) argues that if all the business risk is borne by the equity,
then the formula relating the levered beta ðbL Þ with the asset beta ðbu Þ is
1
If we start with the leverage beta of a company and we unlever that beta, Eqs. (44) and (46) provide the
same answer only if the debt/equity ratio of the company from which we take the levered beta equals the
debt/equity ratio of the company we are valuing.

bL ¼ bu þ ðD=EÞbu ð1  TÞ: This formula is exactly the formula in Eq. (22) assuming
that bd ¼ 0: One interpretation of this assumption is (Damodaran, 1994, p. 31) that
‘‘all of the ﬁrm’s risk is borne by the stockholders (i.e., the beta of the debt is zero).’’
In some cases, it can be reasonable to assume that the debt has a zero beta. But then,
as assumed by Modigliani and Miller (1963) the required return to debt should be the
risk-free rate. This relation for the levered beta appears in many ﬁnance books and is
widely used by many consultants and investment bankers as an attempt to introduce
some leverage cost in the valuation: for a given risk of the assets ðbu Þ; this formula
results in a bL that is higher (and consequently Ke is higher and results in a lower
equity value) than with Eq. (22). In general, it is hard to accept that the debt has no
risk and that the return on the debt is uncorrelated with the return on assets of the
ﬁrm. From Damodaran’s expression for bL it is easy to deduce the relation between
the required return to equity and the required return to assets, i.e., Ke ¼ Ku þ
ðD=EÞð1  TÞðKu  RF ). Although Damodaran does not mention what the value of
tax shields should be, his formula relating the levered beta with the asset beta implies
that the value of tax shields is VTS ¼ PV½Ku ; DTKu  DðKd  RF Þð1  TÞ:
Finally, a common way of calculating the levered beta with respect to the asset
beta (often used by consultants and investment banks) is the following (see, e.g.,
Ruback, 1995, p. 5):
bL ¼ bu ð1 þ D=EÞ:

ð47Þ

It is obvious that given the same value for bu ; a higher bL (and a higher Ke and a
lower equity value) is obtained than according to Eq. (22) or according to
Damodaran (1994).2 Formula (47) relating the levered beta with the asset beta
implies that the value of tax shields is VTS ¼ PV½Ku ; DTKd  DðKd  RF )]. Given its
widespread use in the industry, we will call this method the Practitioners’
method.
Given the large number of alternative methods existing in the literature to
calculate the value of tax shields, Copeland et al. (2000, p. 482) assert that ‘‘the
ﬁnance literature does not provide a clear answer about which discount rate for the
tax beneﬁt of interest is theoretically correct.’’ They further conclude, ‘‘We leave it to
the reader’s judgment to decide which approach best ﬁts his or her situation.’’
We propose two ways to compare and differentiate among the different
approaches. One way is to calculate the value of tax shields for perpetuities
according to the different approaches. A second way is to check the implied relation
between the unlevered and levered cost of equity in each of the different approaches.
The levered cost of equity should always be higher than the cost of assets ðKu Þ; since
equity cash ﬂows are riskier than the free cash ﬂows.
Table 1 summarizes the implications of these approaches for the value of tax
shields in perpetuities. Table 2 summarizes the implications for the relation between
2

We interpret Eq. (47) as an attempt to introduce still higher leverage cost in the valuation. For a given
risk of the assets ðbu Þ; by using Eq. (47) we obtain a higher bL (and consequently a higher Ke and a lower
equity value) than with the approach of Damodaran (1994) or Eq. (22). Damodaran and practitioners
impose a cost of leverage, but they do so in an ad hoc way.

Table 2 shows that not all of the approaches also satisfy the relation between the cost
of equity and the cost of assets. The Modigliani and Miller (1963) and Myers (1974)
approaches do not always give a higher cost of equity than a cost of assets. Myers
obtains Ke lower than Ku if the value of the tax shields is higher than the value of
debt. This happens when DTKd =ðKd  gÞ > D; that is, when the growth rate is higher
than the after-tax cost of debt: g > Kd ð1  TÞ: Please note also that in this situation,
as the value of tax shields is higher than the value of debt, the equity ðEÞ is worth
more than the unlevered equity ðVu Þ: This hardly makes any economic sense.
Modigliani and Miller also provides the inconsistent result of Ke being lower than Ku
if the value of the tax shields is higher than D½Ku  Kd ð1  TÞ=ðKu  gÞ: This
happens when either the leverage, the tax rate, the cost of debt, or the market risk
premium are high. The only approach that provides consistent results for both of
these cases is the one proposed above.
Appendix A is a compendium of the main valuation formulae according to the
different theories.

6. An example of a perpetuity
In this section, I provide a numerical example of how to calculate the value of tax
shield for a simple ﬁrm under the different approaches. Let us start by assuming that
the cash ﬂows generated by the company are perpetual and constant (there is no
growth). The company must invest to maintain its assets at a level that enables it to
ensure constant cash ﬂows: this implies that the book depreciation is equal to the
replacement investment. The ﬁrm’s balance sheet, income statement, cash ﬂows, and
other valuation parameters are shown in Table 3. The breakdown of the value of the
unlevered and levered companies between all the stakeholders in the ﬁrm is
summarized in Fig. 1. The company has three main stakeholders: shareholders,
bondholders, and the government. The value of the tax shield is exactly the
difference between the present value of the government claim of the levered ﬁrm and
the present value of the government claim of the unlevered ﬁrm.
Table 4 reports the estimated value of the equity for the levered ﬁrm, the present
value of tax shields, the cost of equity, the WACC for the levered and unlevered ﬁrm,
and the implied value of the levered beta for each of the seven approaches. My
proposed method, Modigliani and Miller (1963), and Myers (1974) all compute the
value of tax shield to be $200 ðDT ¼ 500 	 0:4 ¼ 200Þ: All the other methods result
in a value of the tax shield that is too low.
Now let us assume that this hypothetical ﬁrm grows at a constant rate of 5%, i.e.,
g ¼ 5%: The ﬁrm’s balance sheet, income statement, cash ﬂows and other valuation
parameters are in Table 5. Note that the balance sheet and the income statement are
identical to those in Table 3 (without growth). However, the cash ﬂows vary.
Table 6 reports the estimated value of the equity for the levered ﬁrm, the present
value of tax shields, the cost of equity, the WACC, the WACC before taxes, the
implied value of the levered beta, and the debt-to-equity ratio for each of the seven
approaches. My proposed method computes the value of the tax shield at $400. The

Table 3
Valuation of a hypothetical ﬁrm without growth: balance sheet, income statement, cash ﬂows and
valuations
This table presents the valuation of a hypothetical ﬁrm without growth using APV (adjusted present
value). The table also shows that four alternative valuations (equity cash ﬂows discounted at the required
return to equity, free cash ﬂows discounted at the WACC, capital cash ﬂows discounted at the WACC
before taxes, and value of tax shields as the difference of two net present values) provide the same
valuation. As shown in Fernandez (2002, Chapter 21), the APV provides the same value as the other most
commonly used methods for valuing companies by cash ﬂow discounting.

methods of Modigliani and Miller (1963) and Myers (1974) result in a value of the
tax shields that is too high (even higher than the debt value) and, correspondingly, a
higher value of equity than the correct one. Please recall that these two methods were
the only methods that for the case of a constant perpetuity computed the same value
of the tax shield. Furthermore, these two methods reach the implausible conclusion
that the beta for the levered ﬁrm should be lower than the beta for the unlevered ﬁrm
(see the ﬁfth column of Table 6). All the other methods result in a value of the
estimated tax shield in line with their results for the case of constant perpetuities, i.e.,
their estimate of the value of the tax shield is too low. As we assume that the value of
debt is 500 in both the growth example and the no-growth example, the debt/equity

the appropriate discount rate were used (reﬂecting the riskiness of the tax shields).’’
The problem is that it is hard to evaluate the riskiness of tax shield because it is
the difference between two present ﬂows (the taxes paid by the unlevered company
and those paid by the levered company) with different risk. On the other hand, if we
were to follow this approach, we could calculate the discount rate K  that
accomplishes
VTS ¼ DTKu =ðKu  gÞ ¼ DTKd =ðK   gÞ:

ð48Þ

The solution is K  ¼ Kd þ g  Kd g=Ku : Unfortunately, this expression does not lend
itself to intuition.

7. Conclusions
This paper shows that the increase in a company’s value due to the use of debt is
not the present value of tax shields due to interest payments. It is the difference
between the present value of the taxes of the unlevered company and the present
value of the taxes of the levered company, which represent two separate cash ﬂows
each with their own risk. The issue of the riskiness of the taxes for both the unlevered
and the levered company is addressed. In perpetuities, the required return to tax in
the unlevered company is equal to the required return to equity in the unlevered
company, and the required return to tax in the levered company is equal to the
required return to equity.
The value of tax shields is the present value of the debt times the tax rate times the
required return to the unlevered equity, all discounted at the unlevered cost of
equity. For a constant perpetuity, this results in a value of the tax shield equal to
the value of debt times the tax rate. For the case of growing perpetuities, this
number is lower than that proposed by either Myers (1974) or Modigliani and
Miller (1963).
The paper also shows that some of the alternative approaches suggested in the
literature lead to inconsistent results. In particular, discounting tax shields at the cost
of debt (Myers, 1974; Brealey and Myers, 2000; and many others) or at the risk-free
rate (Modigliani and Miller, 1963) can result in estimating a lower cost of equity to
the levered ﬁrm than that of the unlevered ﬁrm for growing perpetuities. This seems
clearly unreasonable. On the other hand, to discount tax shields at the required
return to unlevered equity, as suggested by Harris and Pringle (1985), Miles and
Ezzell (1980), and Ruback (2002), results in an estimated value of tax shields that is
too low.
