Abstract
In this paper, we compare the performance of a daily ARCH type model (which uses daily
returns) with the performance of a model based on the daily realized volatility (which uses intraday
returns) when the 1-day ahead value-at-risk (VaR) is to be computed. While the VaR specification
based on a long memory skewed Student model for the daily realized volatility provides adequate 1day-ahead VaR forecasts for two stock indexes (the CAC40 and SP500) and two exchange rate
returns (the YEN – USD and DEM – USD), it does not really improve on the performance of a VaR
model based on the skewed Student APARCH model and estimated using daily data only. Thus both
methods seem to be equivalent. This paper also shows that daily returns standardized by the square
root of the 1-day-ahead forecast of the daily realized volatility are not normally distributed.

intradaily volatility is concerned. Focusing solely on the modelling of daily volatility using
intraday data, the recent literature suggests at least three possible methods for characterizing volatility and risk at an aggregated level, which we take to be equal to 1 day in this
paper.
The first possibility is to sample the intraday data on a daily basis so that closing prices
are recorded, from which daily returns are subsequently computed. In this setting, the
notion of intraday price movements is not an issue, as the method is tantamount to
estimating a volatility model on daily data. One well-known example is the ARCH model
of Engle (1982) and subsequent ARCH type models such as the GARCH model of
Bollerslev (1986) (see Palm, 1996, for a recent survey). The second method is based on the
notion of realized volatility which was recently introduced in the literature by Taylor and
Xu (1997) and Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) and which is grounded in the framework of
continuous time finance with the notion of quadratic variation of a martingale. In this case, a
daily measure of volatility is computed as an aggregated measure of volatility defined on
intraday returns. More specifically, the daily realized volatility is computed as the sum of
the squared intraday returns for the given trading day. We thus make explicit use of the
intraday returns to compute the realized volatility, from which the daily volatility is
modelled. This approach has been popularized recently in a collection of papers such as
Andersen et al. (2000a, 2001a,b,c). Moreover, this method has been shown to perform
equally well for stocks and exchange rate returns. A third possibility is to estimate a high
frequency duration model on price durations for the given asset, and then use this
irregularly time-spaced volatility at the aggregated level. Examples are Engle and Russell
(1997), Gerhard and Hautsch (2002) or Giot (2002).
In this paper, we focus on the first two methods as our aggregation level is equal to 1 day,
and it is not clear how duration models could be of any help in this situation. The recent
literature on realized volatility (see the references given above) and the huge literature on
daily volatility models seem to indicate that a researcher or market practitioner faces two
distinct possibilities when daily volatility is to be modelled. Going one way or the other is
however not a trivial question. If one decides to model daily volatility using daily realized
volatility, then intraday data are needed so that corresponding intraday returns can be
computed. Even today, intraday data remain relatively costly and are not readily available
for all assets. Furthermore, a large amount of data handling and computer programming is
usually needed to retrieve the needed intraday returns from the raw data files supplied by
the exchanges or data vendors. On the contrary, working with daily data is relatively simple
and the data are broadly available. However, one has the feeling that all the relevant data are
not taken into account, i.e. that by going at the intraday level one could get a much better
model.
In this paper, we aim to address this issue by comparing the performance of a daily
ARCH type model (which uses daily returns) with the performance of a model based on the
daily realized volatility (which uses intradaily returns) when the one-step ahead Value-atRisk (VaR) measure is to be computed. This exercise is done for two stock indexes (the
French CAC40 index and the American SP500 index) and two exchange rates vis-a-vis the
US dollar (the YEN –USD and the DEM –USD) for which intraday data are available over a
long time period (i.e. 5 years for the CAC40 and about 12 years for the other series). VaR
modelling is a natural application of volatility models as VaR measures are directly related

to the expected volatility over the relevant time horizon. VaR models have been developed
since the middle of the 1990s to quantify and assess market risk in financial markets. Put
simply, the goal of VaR models is to provide, at a given percentage level and for a portfolio
of (marketable) assets, the most likely loss for a financial institution. For example, the VaR
at level a at the 1-day time horizon is the nominal 1-day loss that will not be exceeded in
100. a portfolio realizations out of 100. The literature on VaR models has grown remarkably
over the last decade because of the popularity of the RiskMetrics VaR specification of JP
Morgan (see below) and the risk-adjusted measures of capital adequacy enforced by the
Basel committee. Textbook material is presented in Jorion (2000) or Saunders (2000) while
recent applications of univariate time series models of the ARCH type to VaR problems are
given in, e.g. Lee and Saltoglu (2001), Danielsson (2002) or Berkowitz and O’Brien
(2002). Because volatility is a key input to VaR models, the characterization of asset
volatility (along with the density distribution of the asset returns) is of paramount
importance when implementing and testing VaR models. We thus have daily and intradaily
data for the stock indexes and exchange rates and aim to ascertain which data is the most
useful to compute daily VaR measures. Indeed, (a) because we have intraday data over a
long time period, we can retrieve the daily closing prices for the indexes and then compute
daily VaR measure using daily ARCH type models; (b) with the intradaily data we can
compute intraday returns and daily realized volatility, and we then have a competing model
for the daily VaR which uses the intraday information.
Our main results can be summarized in one sentence: yes, an (adequate) ARCH type
model can deliver accurate VaR forecasts and this model performs as well as a competing
VaR model based on the realized volatility. The key issue is to use a daily ARCH type
model that clearly recognizes and fully takes into account the key features of the empirical
data such as a high kurtosis and skewness in the observed returns. In this paper, we use the
skewed Student APARCH model (see for instance Lambert and Laurent, 2001: Giot and
Laurent, 2001), which delivers excellent results when applied to daily data. It is also true
that the model based on the realized volatility delivers equally adequate VaR forecasts but
this comes at the expense of using intraday information.1 Thus, for the two indexes and
exchange rates under review, the results clearly indicate that modelling the realized
volatility may be useful, but it is far from being the only game in town. Moreover, we also
extend previous results of Andersen et al. (2001a) by showing that daily returns
standardized by the square root of the 1-day-ahead forecast of the daily realized volatility
are not normally distributed. This implies that, in a forecasting framework such as Valueat-Risk, realized volatility measures must be combined with adequate density distributions.
The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, we describe the
available intraday data and characterize the stylized facts of the realized volatility. In
Section 3, we introduce the two competing models (i.e. the skewed Student APARCH
model for the daily returns and the model based on the realized volatility) and detail the
estimation results. These two models are used to provide 1-day-ahead VaR forecasts for
the stock indexes and exchange rates in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes.

2. Data and stylized facts
2.1. Data
The data are available for two stock indexes and two exchange rates on an intraday basis
and for a relatively long period of time (see details below), which allows VaR modelling and
testing over an extended period of time. For these four series, we consider first daily returns
(which are used by the skewed Student APARCH model) and then 15-min and a 1-h intraday
returns for the stock indexes and the exchange rates, respectively (these intraday returns are
used to compute the daily realized volatility).
Our first asset is the French CAC40 stock index for the 1995 –1999 time period, i.e. 1249
daily observations. The CAC40 index is computed by the Paris Bourse (EURONEXT) as a
weighted measure of the prices of its components. It is available in the database on an
intraday basis with the index being computed approximately every 30 s. For the time period
considered in this paper, the opening hours of the French stock market were from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., thus 7 h of trading per day. With a regularly time-spaced 15-min grid, this translates
into 28 intraday returns which are used to compute the daily realized volatility (see below for
details). Intraday prices for the CAC40 index are computed every 15 min using a linear
interpolation between the closest recorded prices below and above the time set in the grid.
Correspondingly, all returns are computed as the first difference in the regularly time-spaced
log prices of the index. Because the exchange is closed from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. of the next day,
the first intraday return (computed at 10h15 when working with a 15-min time grid for
example) is the first difference between the log price at 10h15 and the log price at 5 p.m. the
day before. Daily returns in percentage are defined as 100 times the first difference of the log
of the closing prices.2
Our second data set contains 12 years (from January 1989 to December 2000, or 3241
daily observations) of tick-by-tick prices for the SP500 futures contracts traded on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Such SP500 futures contracts are traded from 8h30 to
15h10 Chicago time, i.e. from 9h30 to 16h10 New York time. To conveniently define 15min returns, we remove all prices recorded after 16 h New York time.3 Like for the CAC40
data set, intraday prices at the 15-min frequency are the outcomes of a linear interpolation
between the closest recorded prices (for the nearest contract to maturity) below and above
the times in the 15-min grid.4 Returns are computed as the first difference of the regularly
time-spaced log prices of the index, with the overnight return included in the first intraday
return. Daily returns in percentage are defined as 100 times the first difference of the log of
the closing prices.
Our third and fourth data sets contain hourly data for two major exchange rates, the
Japanese yen (YEN) and the Deutsche Mark (DEM) against the US Dollar (USD). For
these two exchange rates, we have about 12 years of intraday data, from January 1989 to
2
By definition and using the properties of the log distribution, the sum of the intraday returns is equal to the
observed daily return based on the closing prices.
3
Thus the last recorded price for the futures at 16 h corresponds more or less to the closing price of the
‘‘cash’’ SP500 index computed from its constituents traded on the NYSE or NASDAQ.
4
The choice of the nearest contract to maturity means that we always select very liquid future contracts.

February 2001. During this period, the US Dollar, the DEM and the YEN were the main
currencies traded in the FOREX market, and thus the volatility of the DEM – USD and
YEN – USD currency returns made up most of the currency risk faced by large institutional
investors and international corporations. The raw data consists of all interbank DEM –
USD and YEN – USD bid –ask quotes displayed on the Reuters FXFX screen during this
period. These quotes are indicative quotes but have been shown to be adequate inputs for
computing intraday returns, see for example Danielsson and Payne (2002). Note that
intraday FOREX returns computed from quoted bid – ask prices are subject to various
market microstructure ‘frictions’, e.g. strategic quote positioning and inventory control.
Such features are generally immaterial when analyzing longer horizon returns, but may
distort the statistical properties of the underlying ‘fundamental’ high-frequency intraday
returns. The sampling frequency at which such considerations become a concern is
intimately related to market activity. For our exchange rate series, preliminary analysis
based on the methods of Andersen et al. (2000b) and Oomen (2001) suggest that the use of
equally spaced 30-min or hourly returns strikes a satisfactory balance between the
accuracy of the continuous-record asymptotics underlying the construction of our realized
volatility measures on the one hand, and the confounding influences from the market
microstructure frictions on the other. As standard in the literature, we compute hourly
exchange rate prices from the linearly interpolated logarithmic average of the bid and ask
quotes for the two ticks immediately before and after the hourly time stamps throughout
the global 24-h trading day. Next we obtain hourly returns as 100 times the first difference
of the equally time-spaced logarithmic prices. To avoid the so-called weekend effect (there
are almost no currency trades during the weekend), we exclude all returns from Friday
21:00 GMT until Sunday 21:00 GMT.
2.2. Realized volatility: definition and stylized facts
Estimating and forecasting volatility is a key issue in empirical finance. After the
introduction of the ARCH model by Engle (1982) or the Stochastic Volatility (SV) model
(see Taylor, 1994) and their various extensions, a new generation of conditional volatility
models has been advocated recently by Taylor and Xu (1997) and Andersen and Bollerslev
(1998), i.e. models making used of the realized volatility. See also the more recent work by
Andersen et al. (2001a) or Andersen et al. (2001b).
The origin of ‘realized volatility’ is not as recent as it would seem at first sight. Merton
(1980) already mentioned that, provided data sampled at a high frequency are available,
the sum of squared realizations can be used to estimate the variance of an i.i.d. random
variable. Taylor and Xu (1997) and Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) (among others) show
that daily realized volatility may be constructed simply by summing up intraday squared
returns. Assuming that a day can be divided in N equidistant periods and if yi,t denotes the
intradaily return of the ith interval of day t, it follows that the daily volatility for day t can
be written as:
"

P
If the returns have a zero mean and are uncorrelated, Ni¼1 y2i;t is a consistent (see Andersen
et al., 2001b,c) and unbiased5 estimator of the daily variance r2t. Because all squared
returns on the right sideP
of this equation
are observed when intraday data (at equidistant
2
periods) are available, ½ Ni¼1 yi;t  is called the daily realized volatility.
By summing high-frequency squared returns we may then obtain an ‘error free/model
free’ measure of the daily volatility.6 However, choosing a very high sampling frequency
(e.g. 30-s or 1-min frequency) may introduce a bias in the variance estimate due to market
microstructure effects (bid – ask bounces, price discreteness or nonsynchronous trading). As
a trade off between these two biases, Andersen et al. (2001b) propose the use of 5-min
returns to compute daily realized volatility. Using the FTSE-100 stock index on the 1990–
2000 time period, Oomen (2001) shows that the realized volatility measure increases when
the sampling interval decreases while the summation of the cross terms in Eq. (1) decreases.
By comparing the average daily realized volatility and the autocovariance bias factor,
Oomen (2001) argues that the optimal sampling frequency for his data set suggests using
25-min returns. For our two stock indexes, a sampling frequency of about 15-min was
found to be optimal.7 For the exchange rates, we choose a sampling frequency of 1 h.
Although the empirical work on realized volatility is still in its infancy, some stylized
facts have already been ascertained:8


First, the unconditional distribution of the realized volatility is highly skewed and
kurtosed. On the other hand, the unconditional distribution of the logarithmic realized
volatility is nearly Gaussian.
 Secondly, the (logarithmic) realized volatility appears to be fractionally integrated.
Indeed, volatility shocks die out very slowly, neither in accordance with an ARMA
structure (which implies an exponential decay) nor with a unit root process.
Correspondingly, the ACF decreases very slowly.
 Finally, according to Ebens (1999) who analyzes the Dow Jones Industrial portfolio
over the January 1993 to May 1998 period, the (logarithmic) realized volatility of stock
indexes are nonlinear in returns. This feature is also well known in ARCH type models
and is known as the leverage effect: past negative shocks on the stock index returns
have a larger impact on current (realized) volatility than past positive shocks (see Black,
5
Areal and Taylor (in press) show that even if this estimator is consistent and unbiased, it has not the least
variance when N is finite. These authors propose to weight the intraday squared returns by a factor proportional to
the intraday activity. This deflator may be obtained easily by applying Taylor and Xu’s (1997) variance multiplier
or the Flexible Fourier Function (FFF) of Andersen and Bollerslev (1997). Due to the strong similarity of the
results with the ‘non-weighted squared returns’, we do not report the results using Areal and Taylor’s (in press)
approach.
6
The theory of quadratic variation shows that, under suitable conditions, realized volatility is not only an
unbiased ex-post estimator of daily return volatility, but also asymptotically free of measurement error (Andersen
et al., 2001b,c).
7
To find the optimal sampling frequency, Oomen (2001) suggests to plot both the sum of squared intradaily
returns and the autocovariance bias factor versus the sampling frequency. The ‘optimal’ sampling frequency is
chosen as the highest available frequency for which the autocovariance bias term has disappeared.
8
In a preliminary version, we highlighted these stylized facts on the two stock indexes. See Giot and Laurent
(2001) for more details. Additional stylized facts about realized volatility are available in Andersen et al. (2001a)
or Andersen et al. (2001b).

1976; French et al., 1987; Pagan and Schwert, 1990 and Zakoian, 1994). Note that an
alternative explanation for this asymmetry is provided by the ‘volatility feedback’
effect, see Campbell and Hentschel (1992). This also holds for realized stock volatility,
but the leverage effect seems to be of minor economic importance, see Andersen et al.
(2001a).

3. Two competing models
Realized volatility was reviewed in the preceding section and we can now introduce an
econometric model for the daily VaR based on this measure. Section 3.2 is devoted to this
topic. As the goal of the paper is to compare the performance of an ARCH type model
directly applied to the daily data with the performance of a model based on the realized
volatility, we also need to characterize the skewed Student APARCH model that will be
needed for the daily data. This is done in the next subsection.
3.1. ARCH type models
A series of asset returns yt (t = 1,. . .,T), known to be conditionally heteroscedastic, is
typically modelled as follows:
yt ¼ lt þ et

ð2Þ

et ¼ rt zt

ð3Þ

lt ¼ cðgAXt1 Þ

ð4Þ

rt ¼ hðgAXt1 Þ;

ð5Þ

where c(	jXt  1) and h(	jXt  1) are functions of Xt  1 (the information set at time t  1),
and depend on an unknown vector of parameters g; zt is an independently and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) process, independent of Xt  1, with E(zt) = 0 and Var(zt) = 1; lt is the
conditional mean of yt and r2t is its conditional variance.
Because daily returns are known to exhibit some serial autocorrelation, we fit an AR(n)
structure on the yt series for all specifications:9
WðLÞðyt  lÞ ¼ et ;

ð6Þ

P
where W(L) = 1  w1L  . . .  wnLn. In this case, lt ¼ l þ ni¼1 wi ðyti  lÞ.
We now consider two possible specifications for the conditional variance of et. First we
detail one of the most simple (but widely used by market practitioners) measure of
9
The serial autocorrelation found in daily returns is not necessarily at odds with the efficient market
hypothesis. See Campbell et al. (1997) for a detailed discussion.

volatility, the RiskMetrics volatility specification. Next we consider the APARCH model,
which is one of the most flexible ARCH-type model.
3.1.1. RiskMetrics
In its most simple form, it can be shown that the basic RiskMetrics model is equivalent
to a normal Integrated GARCH (1,1) model where the autoregressive parameter is set at a
prespecified value of 0.94 and the coefficient of et2 1 is equal to 0.06. In this specification,
we have that zt is i.i.d. N(0, 1) and r2t is defined as:
r2t ¼ 0:06e2t1 þ 0:94r2t1 :

ð7Þ

Therefore, the RiskMetrics specification does not require estimation of unknown
parameters in the volatility equation as all parameters are preset at given values. Although
this is a crude way of modelling volatility, it is widely used by practitioners as this method
often gives acceptable short-term volatility forecasts and it is very simple to use/program
in Excel sheets.
3.1.2. Skewed student APARCH
Recently, Giot and Laurent (2003) have shown that (unlike the RiskMetrics model or
more simple ARCH-type models) the skewed Student APARCH (in short SKST
APARCH) model does provide accurate VaR forecasts, both for the right and left tails
of the distribution of returns. The APARCH (Ding et al., 1993) is an extension of the
GARCH model of Bollerslev (1986) that nests at least seven GARCH specifications. In
the case of an APARCH(1,1), Eq. (5) is:
rt ¼ ½x þ a1 ðAet1 A  an et1 Þd þ b1 rdt1 1=d ;

ð8Þ

where x, a1, an, b1 and d are additional parameters to be estimated. d (d>0) plays the role
of a Box-Cox transformation of rt, while an(  1 < an < 1), reflects the so-called leverage
effect. The properties of the APARCH model have been studied recently by He and
Teräsvirta (1999a,b).
In VaR applications, the choice of an appropriate distribution for the innovation process
(zt) is an important issue as it directly affects the ‘quality’ of the estimation of the required
quantiles. As in Giot and Laurent (2003) or Giot (2003), we use a standardized version of
the skewed Student distribution introduced by Fernández and Steel (1998).10 According to
Lambert and Laurent (2001) and provided that t > 2, the innovation process zt is said to be
(standardized) skewed Student distributed, i.e. zt f SKST(0,1,n,t), if:

Giot and Laurent (2003) show that an AR-APARCH model with a skewed Student density succeeds in
correctly forecasting (both in- and out-of-sample) the 1-day-ahead VaR for three international stock indexes and
three US stocks of the Dow Jones index. Models based on the normal or Student distributions clearly
underperform when applied to the same data sets.

where g(	jt) is a symmetric (unit variance) Student density and n is the asymmetry

In short, n models the asymmetry, while t accounts for the tail thickness. See Lambert
and Laurent (2001) for a discussion of the link between these two parameters and the
skewness and the kurtosis.
3.2. Realized volatility model
Regarding the realized volatility, its main features are that the logarithmic realized
volatility is approximately normal, appears to be fractionally integrated and correlated with
past negative shocks (see Section 2.2). To take these properties into account, let us
consider the following ARFIMAX(0,d,1) model (initially developed by Granger, 1980;
Granger and Joyeux, 1980 among others):
ð1  LÞd ðlnRVt  l0  l1 yt1  l2 y

ð1  LÞd ¼

l

k¼0

ð12Þ

where L is the lag operator, l0, l1, l2, h1 and d are parameters to be estimated, ut is an i.i.d.
random process with mean 0 and variance ru, lnRVt is the logarithm of the realized
volatility computed from the intraday returns observed for day t, yt is the daily return on
day t, yt takes the value 0 when yt>0 and the value yt when yt < 0. Note that to determine
the orders of this ARFIMA model we rely on the Schwarz (SC) information criterion.
When ut f N(0,ru2), we have by definition that exp(ut) f logN(0,ru2) (where logN
denotes the log-normal distribution). Thus, the conditional realized volatility is computed
according to:
	


1 2
RVtAt1 ¼ exp lnRVt  ût þ r̂u ;
ð13Þ
2
where ût denotes the estimated value of ut by Eq. (12) and r̂u2 is the estimated variance of
ut in the same equation.
11

The asymmetry coefficient n>0 is defined such that the ratio of probability masses above and below the
2
mean is Prðez0AnÞ
Prðe<0AnÞ ¼ n . Note also that the density f(ej1/n,t) is the symmetric of f(ej1/n,t) with respect to the mean.
Therefore, working with ln(n) might be preferable to indicate the sign of the skewness.

P. Giot, S. Laurent / Journal of Empirical Finance 11 (2004) 379–398

To compute a 1-day-ahead forecast for the VaR of the daily returns yt using the
conditional realized volatility, we now reestimate the model defined by Eqs. (2) –(5),
where the conditional mean is the usual AR(n) process while the conditional variance is
proportional to RVtjt  1 detailed above, i.e. r2t = r2RVtjt  1 (with r2 being an additional
parameter to be estimated). In other words, all the dynamics of the conditional variance is
assumed to be captured by the ARFIMAX model. This assumption will be tested in the
empirical application. Note that r2 is used to ensure that the rescaled innovations of the
second step have a unit variance.
This specification is almost identical to the specification introduced in Section 3.1, but in
this case the conditional volatility for the daily returns is proportional to the conditional
realized volatility RVtjt  1 and thus uses the information provided by the intradaily returns
of day t  1. As in Section 3.1, an adequate distribution for the innovation process (zt)
should be selected. The recent empirical literature (see Andersen et al., 2001a) has stressed
that daily returns standardized by their ex post realized volatility (RVt) are nearly Gaussian.
Hence, an obvious first choice for the distribution of zt would be the Gaussian distribution.
However, because we want to forecast the 1-day-ahead VaR, RVt is not observed at time
t  1 and one has to rely on its 1-day-ahead forecast, i.e. RVtjt  1. As shown in the next
subsection, this seemingly minor change has far-reaching consequences as it invalidates the
choice of the normal distribution as an adequate distribution for zt. Therefore, we suggest
the use of the skewed Student distribution introduced above (or SKST RV model) to take
into account the skewness and kurtosis of zt. We also present results for the normal
distribution (in short Normal RV model) to motivate our choice of a more flexible density
distribution and allow for a comparison with recent results given in the literature on realized
volatility.
3.3. Estimation results
In this subsection, we report estimation results for the two competing models detailed in
Section 3.1 and 3.2. Estimation of the GARCH-type models is done by approximate
maximum likelihood using G@RCH 3.0 (see Laurent and Peters, 2002). Estimation of Eq.
(12) is carried out by exact maximum likelihood (Sowel, 1992) under the normality
assumption using ARFIMA 1.0 (see Ooms and Doornik, 1998; Doornik and Ooms, 1999)
and conditional sum-of-squares maximum likelihood (Hosking, 1981) using G@RCH 3.0
(see Laurent and Peters).12 Because the estimation procedures provide very similar
outcomes, we only report the results obtained with the first method. Finally, estimation
of the second step involved in the realized volatility approach is carried out using G@RCH
3.0. The Ox codes are available upon request.
Our first framework uses the daily models defined in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. To
simplify the layout of the tables, we only report the results pertaining to the conditional
variance equation and the skewed Student density. Note that, based on the SC criterion, an
AR(1) specification has been selected for the conditional mean of the SP500 index returns
while no dynamics is needed for the other series. To check the adequacy of the overall
12
The finite sample properties of the conditional sum-of-squares maximum likelihood have been
investigated by Chung and Baillie (1993).

where ni is the number of observations in cell i and Eni is the expected number of
observations (based on the ML estimates). For i.i.d. observations and under the null of a
correct distribution, P( g) is distributed as a v2( g  1). Actually, as shown by Palm and
Vlaar (1997), the asymptotic distribution of P( g) is bounded between a v2( g  1) and a
v2( g  k  1) where k is the number of estimated parameters. Since our conclusions hold
for both critical values and for various values of g, we report the significance levels relative
to v2( g  1), with g = 20, i.e. P(20) in the tables.
The results given in Table 1 show that:
– b1 is close to 1 but significantly different from 1 for all series, which indicates a high
degree of volatility persistence.13 Furthermore, in all cases the APARCH models are
stationary in the sense that a1E(AzA  anz)d + b1 is lower than 1.
– d is close to 1 for the SP500 index and not significantly different from 2 for the other
series: the APARCH models the conditional standard deviation for the SP500 and the
conditional variance for the other time series.
– For the stock indexes, an is significantly positive: negative returns lead to higher
subsequent volatility than positive returns (asymmetry in the conditional variance).
However, no leverage effect is detected for the exchange rates.
13
Tse (1998) extended the APARCH by including a pure long memory feature (FIAPARCH). LR tests
between the APARCH and the FIAPARCH clearly reject the FIAPARCH specification.

– t is much larger for the CAC40 index than for the other series: daily returns of the
SP500 index, YEN –USD and DEM – USD exchange rates display a much larger
kurtosis and exhibit fatter tails than returns for the French data.
– For the two exchange rates, ln(n) is significantly different from 0, which indicates that
the innovations of the YEN –USD (resp. DEM – USD) returns are positively (resp.
negatively) skewed while those of the CAC40 and the SP500 indexes are symmetric.
– The AR-APARCH succeeds in taking into account all the dynamical structure exhibited
by the returns and volatility of the returns as the Ljung-Box on the standardized
residuals ( Q20) and the squared standardized residuals ( Q220) are always nonsignificant
at the 5% level.
– Finally, the relevance of the skewed Student APARCH model is ascertained by the
Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic P(20).
In our second framework, we explicitly use the information provided by the intradaily
returns to compute the daily realized volatility. We first estimate an ARFIMAX(0,d,1)
model on the logarithmic realized volatility lnRVt as in Eq. (12). In a second step, we
assume that the conditional mean of yt follows the same AR structure as previously, while
the conditional variance of the daily returns is expressed as r2t = r2RVtjt  1, with r2 being an
additional parameter to be estimated. Note that to perform this second step, one has to make
an additional assumption on the innovation process. As outlined at the end of Section 3.2,
one assumes first that zt is normally distributed and then skewed Student distributed. Table
2 presents estimation results for this second method. Panel I of the table deals with the

ARFIMAX specification while Panel II is related to the second step. Note that to save
space, we do not report the estimated parameters of the conditional mean in Panel II.
Several comments can be made:
– First, the specification seems to succeed in modelling the dynamics of the first two
2
conditional moments of the series. Indeed, the Ljung-Box statistics Q20 and Q20
indicate
that the serial correlation in the error term and its square has been taken care of (at the
conventional levels of significance).
– Parameter d is well above 0 for the four series. Actually, one has the typical value of 0.4
for the exchange rates (see Andersen et al., 2001b,c) and a slightly larger value for the
stock indexes. In all cases, d is lower than 0.5 (even if not statistically different from 0.5
for the stock indexes), which indicates that the logarithm of the realized volatility might
be covariance-stationary.
– l2 is significantly negative for all series: negative returns lead to higher subsequent
volatility than positive returns (asymmetry in the conditional variance similar to the
APARCH model). Note that this result differs from the one obtained with the APARCH
model, where no leverage effect was detected for the exchange rates.
– While the recent literature has stressed that ex post standardized returns have an almost
normal distribution (see Andersen et al., 2000a,b, 2001a), this is zcertainly not true for
ex ante standardized returns, i.e. returns standardized by the square root of the 1-dayahead forecast of the daily realized volatility. The estimated parameters ln(n) and t
reported in Table 2 suggest that the ex ante standardized returns of the CAC40, SP500,
YEN – USD and DEM –USD are kurtosed and skewed (this is particularly true for the
exchange rates).14 Hence, while daily returns standardized by the ex post square root of
the daily realized volatility are normally distributed, the same daily returns standardized
by the square root of the 1-day-ahead forecast of the daily realized volatility are not
normally distributed. As shown in the next section on Value-at-Risk, this implies that, in
a forecasting framework, realized volatility measures must be combined with adequate
density distributions.

4. Assessing the VaR performance of the models assessing
In the last part of the paper, we now focus on the application of the volatility models
detailed previously to a Value-at-Risk application. As indicated in the introduction where
we briefly reviewed the VaR framework, our goal in this paper is to ascertain if volatility
models based on the realized volatility improves on the 1-day ahead daily VaR forecasts
made by a model based on daily returns. In both cases, we choose the skewed Student
density distribution as the density distribution for the standardized error term to take into
account the salient features of the returns standardized by the volatility forecast. The latter is
first equal to the daily volatility forecast (skewed Student APARCH model), and then based
on the realized volatility measure (skewed Student realized volatility model). We also
present results for the popular RiskMetrics method and the normal realized volatility model.
14

These results are in line with those reported in Table 1 (skewed Student APARCH on daily returns).

392

More specifically, we use the estimated coefficients reported in the previous tables to
compute the volatility forecasts used as inputs in the computation of the 1-day-ahead VaR
for the four series. When assuming a normal distribution for the innovations, the VaR for
long trading positions (i.e. left tail of the density distribution of returns) is given by lt + zart,
while for short trading positions (i.e. right tail of the density distribution of returns) it is
equal to lt + z1  art, with za being the left quantile at a% for the normal distribution and
z1  a the right quantile at a%. When assuming a skewed Student distribution, the VaR for
long trading positions is given by lt + sksta,t,nrt and lt + skst1  a,t,nrt, with sksta,t,n being
the left quantile at a% for the skewed Student distribution with t degrees of freedom and
asymmetry coefficient n; skst1  a,t,n is the corresponding right quantile.15 If ln(n) is
smaller than zero (or n < 1), Asksta,t,nA>Askst1  a,t,nA and the VaR for long trading
positions will be larger (for the same conditional variance) than the VaR for short trading
positions. When ln(n) is positive, we have the opposite result. Therefore, the skewed
Student density distribution allows for asymmetric VaR forecasts and fully takes into
account the fact that the density distribution of asset returns can be substantially skewed.
See for example Chen et al. (2001) for a discussion and motivation of skewness in
financial returns.
All models are tested with a VaR level a which ranges from 5% to 0.25% and their
performance is then assessed by computing the failure rate for the returns yt. By definition,
the failure rate is the number of times returns exceed (in absolute value) the forecasted VaR.
This measure is also called the proportion of VaR violations, where a VaR violation is
defined as an occurrence of a market returns larger (in absolute value) than the forecasted
VaR. If the VaR model is correctly specified, the failure rate should be equal to the
prespecified VaR level, i.e. a. In our empirical application, we define a failure rate fl for the
long trading positions, which is equal to the percentage of negative returns smaller than
one-step-ahead
VaR for long positions (left tail of the density distribution of the returns), i.e.
P
1=T Tt¼1 Iðyt < VaRt ðaÞÞ , where I(	) is the indicator function and VaRt(a) is the VaR
forecast at time t and at a%. Correspondingly, we define fs as the failure rate for short
trading positions as the percentage of positive returns larger than the one-step-ahead VaR
for short positions (right tail of the density distribution of the returns). Using a procedure
that is now standard in the VaR literature, we assess the models’ performance by first
computing their empirical failure rates, both for the left and right tails of the distribution of
returns. Because the computation of the empirical failure rate defines a sequence of yes
(VaR violation)/no (no VaR violation) observations, it is possible to test H0: f = a against H1:
f p a, where f is the failure rate (estimated by f̂, the empirical failure rate). In the literature on
VaR models, this test is also called the Kupiec LR test, if the hypothesis is tested using a
likelihood ratio test (see Kupiec, 1995). The LR statistic is LR =  2ln(aT  N(1  a)N) +
2ln((1  (N/T))T  N(N/T)N), where N is the number of VaR violations, T is the total
number of observations and f is the theoretical failure rate. Under the null hypothesis
that f is the true failure rate, the LR test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a v2(1).
Besides the failure rate, a relevant VaR model should feature a sequence of indicator
functions (VaR violations) that is not serially correlated. With the new variables
15
The quantile function of the (standardized) skewed Student has been derived in Lambert and Laurent
(2001) as a mixture of two Student quantile functions. See also Giot and Laurent (2003).

Hitt(a) = I( yt < VaRt(a))  a and Hitt(1  a) = I( yt>VaRt(1  a))  a, Engle and Manganelli
(1999) suggest to test jointly that:


A1: E(Hitt(a)) = 0 (respectively E(Hitt(1  a)) = 0) in the case of long trading positions
(short trading positions).
 A2: Hitt(a) (or Hitt(1  a)) is uncorrelated with the variables included in the
information set.
According to Engle and Manganelli (1999), testing A1 –A2 can be done using the
artificial regression Hitt = Xk + et, where X is a T  k matrix whose first column is a column
of ones, the next q columns are Hitt  1,. . .,Hitt  q and the k  q  1 remaining columns are
additional independent variables (including the VaR itself). Engle and Manganelli (1999)
VX k̂ a 2
also show that under the null A1 –A2, the Dynamic Quantile test statistic k̂VX
að1aÞ f v ðkÞ,
where k̂ is the OLS estimates of k. A small sample version of this test ( F-test) is readily
obtained but the difference is negligible since the sample size is larger than 1000
observations. Note that while Engle and Manganelli (1999) only consider long trading
positions, we also use this test when computing the VaR of short trading positions.
Table 3 reports the P-values for the Kupiec (1995) failure rate test, while Table 4
presents the results for the Engle and Manganelli (1999) regression quantile tests with
q = 5 and k = 7 (i.e. we include the contemporaneous VaR forecast as additional explanatory variable). For both tests, each panel presents successively the results for the
RiskMetrics, SKST APARCH, normal RV and SKST RV models. Let us first compare
the results given in rows 3 and 4 of each panel, i.e. the results for the normal and skewed
Student realized volatility specification. The empirical results given in both tables tell the
same story. First and for the normal RV specification, the P-values for the null hypothesis
of both tests are often smaller than 0.05, especially when a is below 1%. Secondly the
skewed Student RV model performs very well as there are almost no P-values smaller than
0.05, whatever the test and the tail one takes into account. Thus the switch from the normal
distribution to the skewed Student distribution yields a significant improvement in the VaR
performance of the model set in the realized volatility framework. In a second step, we
now compare the results given in rows 2 and 4 of each panel, i.e. the results for the skewed
Student APARCH model (daily data only) and the skewed Student realized volatility
specification (which uses intradaily data). It is quite striking that we get very close (from a
qualitative point of view) results: in most cases, P-values are larger than 0.05, both for the
model that uses the daily data and for the model that uses the intradaily data (realized
volatility). Therefore, using an APARCH model with daily data or a two-step approach
relying on the realized volatility leads to very similar results in terms of VaR performance,
provided that one correctly specify the full conditional density (the skewed Student density
distribution) for both methods.
This implies that previous results given in the empirical literature must be qualified. For
example, Ebens (1999) concludes his paper by stating that the GARCH model underperforms (when volatility must be forecasted) with respect to the model based on the daily
realized volatility. However, the author uses a GARCH model that neither really accounts
for the long memory property observed in the realized volatility nor the fat-tails or
asymmetry of the returns (even after standardization). Indeed, when estimating the more

an IGARCH model with prespecified coefficients, under the additional assumption of

its 1-day-ahead forecasting performance is rather poor, especially when a is small.16 With
a more ‘sophisticated’ model on the other hand, VaR results are much better. Interestingly
(and this confirms what we showed in Section 3.3 where we compared the statistical
properties of the ex ante standardized returns obtained with the normal and skewed
Student distributions), the same conclusion is true for the more complex model based on
the combination of intraday returns and realized volatility. Therefore, this also shows that
dealing with realized volatility in a forecasting framework does not mean that the normal
distribution is a natural and obvious choice for the distribution of returns (which it is for ex
post standardized returns). In other words, a forecasting framework where realized

Although the results are not reported in the paper, we also estimated a normal GARCH(1,1) model and its
performance was not much better than the RiskMetrics specification.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have shown how to compute a daily VaR measure for two stock indexes
(the CAC40 and SP500 stock indexes) and two exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar
(YEN – USD and DEM –USD) using volatility forecasts based on realized volatility. The
daily realized volatility is equal to the sum of the squared intraday returns over a given day
and thus uses intraday information to define an aggregated daily volatility measure. While
the VaR forecasts which use this method perform adequately over our sample, we also show
that a more simple model based solely on daily returns also delivers nice results. Indeed,
while the VaR specification based on an ARFIMAX(0,d,1)-skewed Student model for the
daily realized volatility provides adequate 1-day-ahead VaR forecasts, it does not really
improve on the performance of a VaR model based on the skewed Student APARCH model

and estimated using daily data. Thus, for the four financial assets considered in our study,
the two methods seem to be rather equivalent provided that one correctly specify the full
conditional density (the skewed Student density distribution) for both methods and one
does not use the normal distribution (even in the realized volatility framework). Another
important conclusion of our paper is that daily returns standardized by the square root of the
1-day-ahead forecast of the daily realized volatility are not normally distributed. This
extends recent results on realized volatility (such as Andersen et al., 2001a) and shows that,
in a forecasting framework such as Value-at-Risk, realized volatility measures must be
combined with adequate density distributions.
At this stage, one of the most immediate and promising extension of these techniques
is to consider corresponding multivariate volatility models to forecast the VaR of a
portfolio of financial assets. Multivariate models of the ARCH type are not easy to
implement as they often require the estimation of a large number of parameters.
Furthermore, these parameters are present in the latent volatility specification and this
is one of the main difficulty of the problem. Therefore, multivariate realized volatility
models should provide a much easier way to correctly model variances and correlations
across financial assets as they assume that volatility is observed. This paves the way for
the use of ‘usual’ multivariate models (VAR, ECM) directly applied to realized volatility
and correlations.
