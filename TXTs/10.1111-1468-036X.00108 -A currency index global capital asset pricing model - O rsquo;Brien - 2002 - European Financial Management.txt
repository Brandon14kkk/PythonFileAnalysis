Abstract
The application of an international capital asset pricing relationship with two
factors, the global market portfolio and a currency index, is described and
illustrated. The model and illustration help demonstrate a problem with the common
practice of adjusting an asset's expected rate of return across currencies via nominal
riskless interest rate differentials.
Keywords: international; asset; pricing.
JEL classification: G15.

1. Introduction
In a global financial market, arbitrage should force the value of an internationally
traded asset to be the same across currency borders, adjusted for exchange rates.
Given this cross-border valuation condition, an international CAPM permits the
consistent expression of an asset's equilibrium expected return in any currency. For
developed countries with globally integrated markets, an international CAPM with
cross-border pricing consistency is thus a more appropriate valuation tool than the
domestic, segmented-market CAPM.

One international CAPM is the nominal global CAPM, or GCAPM, in which the
single benchmark is the global market portfolio. The GCAPM has been applied by Jorion
and Schwartz (1986) and Stulz (1995b,c). While the GCAPM should be a better valuation
tool for internationally traded assets than the domestic CAPM, there is a growing body of
empirical evidence that systematic exposure to exchange rate changes may be `priced' in
financial markets, in addition to systematic exposure to market portfolio returns. 1
Accordingly, an international CAPM consistent with this empirical evidence may be
even more useful than the single-factor GCAPM. A potential candidate is the general
international capital asset pricing model (ICAPM), pioneered by Solnik (1974), Sercu
(1980), Stulz (1981), and Adler and Dumas (1983). In the general ICAPM, where
purchasing power parity (PPP) is assumed to be violated, systematic exposure to
exchange rate changes is a risk that is priced. Also in support of this theory is an
overwhelming amount of empirical evidence that PPP is violated. 2
However, the general ICAPM has an exchange rate risk factor for each currency in
the global market and thus is cumbersome to apply. This practitioner problem may be
addressed, following Ross and Walsh (1983), with a portfolio representation of the
exchange rate factors. This approach implies a two-factor international CAPM, where
the first factor is the global market portfolio and the second is a portfolio of riskless
deposits in various currencies, or currency index. The true weights of the currency index
of the theory are generally unobservable and depend on country-specific degrees of
relative risk aversion and levels of national wealth. However, one may expect the model
to be applied by practitioners with an observable `proxy' currency index, just as a
`proxy' for the true market portfolio is used in practice with the CAPM and GCAPM.
This article describes an application of the `currency index' global CAPM, or CIGCAPM. Section 2 discusses the model, while Section 3 illustrates an application, also
comparing the valuation with that of the single-factor GCAPM. Section 4 discusses
the issue of converting an asset's required rate of return across currency borders.
Section 5 concludes.
2. Currency index global capital asset pricing model
The risk-return relationship of the CI-GCAPM is shown in equation (1). The
derivation, provided in the Appendix, is based on the assumptions that (1) purchasing
power parity is violated, and (2) inflation in home goods is nonstochastic.

The international CAPM is reviewed in Ross and Walsh (1983), Dumas (1994), Stulz (1995a), and
Solnik (1997). Solnik points out that a single-factor international CAPM representation is possible
by viewing asset returns hedged against exchange rate risk and a (partly) hedged global market
portfolio. The model's risk-return relationship here is expressed in terms of unhedged returns.
For examples of the empirical rejection of PPP, see Abuaf and Jorion (1990), Engel and
Hamilton (1990), Evans and Lewis (1993), and Rogoff (1996). Rogoff summarizes the empirical
results and concludes that short-run deviations from PPP are large and volatile, and indeed, the
1-month conditional volatility of real exchange rates (the volatility of deviations from PPP) is of
the same order of magnitude as the conditional volatility of nominal exchange rates.

A Currency Index Global CAPM

where
Ri, r, Rm, and Rx are based on nominal returns from the viewpoint of one currency,
referred to as the pricing currency,
Ri is the return on asset i, consisting of the asset's local currency return and the
percentage change in the value of the asset's local currency (relative to the pricing
currency),
r is the nominal riskfree rate of the pricing currency,
Rm is the return (in the pricing currency) on the unhedged global market portfolio,
Rx is the return on an index of currency deposits, where the return on each currency
deposit includes both the nominal riskfree rate of that currency and the percent
change in the value of the currency (relative to the pricing currency), and
im and ix are bivariate regression coefficients of Ri versus Rm and Rx. 3
The CI-GCAPM may be stated in the form of equation (1) with any
currency serving as the pricing currency. Like all international asset pricing
models, the transformation between currencies preserves the no-arbitrage value of
any internationally traded asset at spot exchange rates. Note that the two
systematic risk factors do not have to be uncorrelated. As a result, both of the
systematic factors affect Ri in two ways in equation (1). For example, variation in
Rx affects Ri directly through  ix and indirectly through  im and the covariance of
Rm with Rx.
As pointed out in Dumas (1994), the general ICAPM also provides a risk-adjusted
equilibrium relationship between the riskless interest rate differential and the
equilibrium expected rate of change of an exchange rate. Let xk be the percentage
change in currency k relative to the pricing currency, kp. Then in the CI-GCAPM, we
have that
E(xk )  r ÿ rk  km [E(Rm ) ÿ r]   kx [E(Rx ) ÿ r]

(2)

where
xk is the percentage change in currency k relative to currency kp,
rk is currency k's nominal riskfree rate, and
 km and kx are, respectively, the bivariate regression sensitivities of the percentage
change in the value of currency k (relative to kp ) to the global market portfolio
and the currency deposit index.
Equation (2) is a statement of the risk-adjusted uncovered interest rate parity
(UIRP) condition in the CI-GCAPM. Equation (2) follows from viewing currency k's
nominally riskless asset as a risky asset from the viewpoint of currency kp, and noting

that risks and required returns have the same equilibrium pricing structure, whether a
risky asset is a stock or a foreign currency deposit. 4
As shown in the Appendix, in the CI-GCAPM, the risk premia on the two factors
must satisfy the conditions of equations (3a) and (3b):
E(Rm ) ÿ r   var(Rm )  (1 ÿ )cov(Rm, Rx )

(3a)

E(Rx ) ÿ r   cov(Rx, Rm )  (1 ÿ )var(Rx )

(3b)

where
 is the `market price of risk', a wealth-weighted aggregate of investors' degrees of
relative risk aversion.
Equations (3a) and (3b) are useful in ensuring an asset's consistent valuation across
currencies in the illustration of the CI-GCAPM application in the next section.
Solnik (1997) pointed out that market segmentation would imply a more complex
international pricing relationship than the CI-GCAPM of equation (1). However,
while `home bias' behavior has been observed, Solnik contends that current empirical
evidence, while still fragmentary, supports the conclusion that assets are priced in an
integrated financial market, except possibly for emerging and smaller market assets.
3. An illustration of applying the CI-GCAPM
The application of the CI-GCAPM for purposes of estimating an asset's cost of
capital is demonstrated in this section. Also, the principle of consistent cost of capital
estimation across currencies is demonstrated for an asset assumed to be traded in an
integrated financial market where the CI-GCAPM holds.
The asset's returns used in the analysis were those actually realized by the ADRs of
the British company, Grand Metropolitan, PLC (GrandMet). The valuation of the
asset is assumed to have taken place in April 1997, using parameters estimated with
monthly historical data from April 1991 through March 1997. Equation (1) is applied
in both US dollars and sterling to find the (consistent) equilibrium expected rate of
return of an asset in both currencies.
The global market portfolio is `proxied' by the MSCI World Index, and the
currency index is `proxied' by the Federal Reserve Trade-Weighted Index of G-10
currencies. 5 The analysis employs Stulz' (1995c) estimate of the annual expected risk
4

In equation (2) the equilibrium expected change in a currency value depends on the expected
change in the currency index portfolio, E(Rx ). This circularity is reminiscent of that in the
original CAPM, where the expected return on a stock depends on the expected return of the
market portfolio.
5

These proxies were chosen for use in the illustration, as the data were readily available. By
construction, the Financial Times All-Actuaries World Index is more of a proper portfolio than
the MSCI index, as Steve Brown has explained to us. Also, broader currency indexes than the one
we used are available and are more consistent with the spirit of the CI-GCAPM. In practitioner
applications, use of the G-10 currency index may be a usable `proxy' for the true currency index,
just as the S & P 500 index is a usable `proxy' for the domestic US market portfolio. Technically,
since the riskless US dollar asset is one of the currency deposits of the currency index portfolio,
the G-10 index should be `weighted' by 1 minus the weight of the riskless US dollar asset in the
currency deposit portfolio. This weighting was not performed here.

premium in US dollars on the global market portfolio, 5.40%, which is about 0.45%
monthly.
3a. Equilibrium expected rate of return (in US dollars)
Since the risk premium on the global market portfolio is assumed to be known in US
dollars (5.4% annually), the asset's equilibrium expected rate of return is first
determined by applying the CI-GCAPM in US dollars. Assuming the CI-GCAPM
holds, and with monthly empirical estimates in US dollars of 0.000873 for var(Rm) and
0.0000957 for cov(Rm, Rx), an estimate of the global market price of risk consistent
with equation (3a) is 5.666. 6
With the estimate of 5.666 for  and the estimates of 0.000397 for the monthly
var(Rx) and 0.0000957 for the monthly cov(Rm, Rx), an estimate of the expected
monthly risk premium on the currency factor, E(Rx ) ÿ r, consistent with equation (3b)
is ÿ0.00131 in US dollars (about ÿ1.57% annualized). The interpretation of this value
is that in equilibrium, the rate of return in US dollars on a portfolio of interest-earning
currency deposits is expected to be lower than the US dollar riskfree rate, due to an
expected appreciation of the US dollar and=or lower interest rates on the currency
deposits.
The nominal 1-month risk free interest rate in US dollars used in the valuation is
0.46875%, determined by dividing by 12 the annualized 1-month eurodollar rate of
5.625% in the Financial Times of 29 April 1997.
The asset parameters in the CI-GCAPM are the bivariate betas for GrandMet's
ADRs relative to the global market portfolio and the currency index. These beta
estimates, computed with monthly US dollar returns for the April 1991 to March 1997
period, are  im  1.1017 and ix  ÿ0.1182. The market and asset parameters using US
dollars as the pricing currency are summarized in Figure 1.
The asset's equilibrium (monthly) expected rate of return in the CI-GCAPM in US
dollars is thus E(Ri)  0.0046875  1.1017[0.0045] ÿ 0.1182[ÿ0.00131]  0.0098. The
corresponding annualized equilibrium expected rate of return on the asset in US
dollars, is about 0.1176, or 11.76% per annum.
What would have been the asset's estimated equilibrium expected rate of return
with the single-factor GCAPM? The asset's estimated single-factor beta, cov(Ri, Rm )=
var(Rm), is 1.089 computed with the same data. Thus the single-factor GCAPM
estimate of the monthly equilibrium expected rate of return is
0.0046875  1.089[0.0045]  0.0096, or 0.1151 annualized. In US dollars, there is only
25 basis points difference between the CI-GCAPM and single-factor GCAPM
6
Harvey (1991) estimated a global price of risk of 11.47 for the G-7 countries using a singlefactor GCAPM and data in US dollars, but rejected the hypothesis that this estimate was the
same across countries, as should be the case with integrated markets if the single-factor
GCAPM is the correct model. With US stocks, Harvey's estimated global market price of risk
was 5.37, and with UK stocks it was 8.89. Of course, these estimates were determined from
average returns actually experienced in the markets. Assuming that average returns in each
market reflected expectations during the 1970± 1989 time period of the Harvey data, then either
(a) a different model, such as the CI-GCAPM, would have resulted in a consistent, but different,
global price of risk, or (more likely) (b) the financial markets Harvey studied were simply not yet
well integrated during 1970± 1989, and were moreover in the process of moving to a new, global
equilibrium.

annualized cost of equity estimates for GrandMet, a point that is discussed further
below.
3b. Equilibrium expected rate of return (in sterling)
Now consider the same returns on GrandMet ADRs as they would have been realized
in sterling by a British investor. The parameter values used above that pertain to US
dollar returns must be consistently translated into sterling. 7 The global market price
of risk requires no translation, as it characterizes behavioral attitudes (in the
aggregate) about risk-return tradeoffs, and thus is a pure number independent of
currencies and numeraires. Thus  retains the numerical value of 5.666 in the sterling
analysis.
The monthly empirical estimates, in sterling, are 0.001206 for var(Rm ), 0.000275 for
var(Rx), and 0.000202 for cov(Rm, Rx). The equilibrium expected monthly risk premia
on the global market portfolio and on the currency index, in sterling, are determined
from equations (3a, b). Equation (3a) produces the monthly expected risk premium on
the global market portfolio in sterling of E(Rm ) ÿ r  5.666(0.001206) ÿ
4.666(0.000202)  0.00589 (about 7.07% annualized), and equation (3b) produces
the monthly expected risk premium on the currency index in sterling of E(Rx ) ÿ r 
5.666(0.000202) ÿ 4.666(0.000275)  ÿ0.0001386 (about ÿ1.66% annualized). 8
7
By the no-arbitrage relation between the US dollar price of the ADRs, the sterling price of the
actual shares, and the exchange rate, the sterling returns on GrandMet's ADR are the same as
the sterling returns on the actual shares. For GrandMet's returns in sterling, actual exchange
rate conversions were made here from the monthly GrandMet ADR returns data.
The analogous conversions in the international CAPM theory are made with the Ito
approximation. See Dumas (1994) and Sercu and Uppal (1995). In the Ito approximation, the
percentage change in $=£ is equal to the variance of the percentage exchange rate changes minus
the percentage change in £=$ (which implies that the variance of the percentage exchange rate
changes is the same from either exchange rate direction.) With the Ito approximation, the return
of an asset in currency kp is equal to its return in currency k (Rik) plus the percentage change is
the value of currency k (xk) plus cov(Rik, xk ).
8

An alternative, and perhaps easier, method for finding the equilibrium expected rates of return
on the global market portfolio and currency deposit index, in sterling, is to convert from the US
dollar expected returns by applying equation (4).

Fig. 2. Monthly market and asset parameters in sterling

The nominal 1-month risk free interest rate in sterling, 0.515625%, was determined
by dividing by 12 the annualized 1-month eurosterling rate of 6.1875% in the
Financial Times of 29 April 1997.
The bivariate betas for GrandMet relative to the global market portfolio and the
currency index, computed with monthly sterling returns for April 1991 to March 1997,
are im  1.0593 and ix  0.6036. The market and asset parameters using sterling as
the pricing currency are summarized in Figure 2.
Since GrandMet's bivariate betas with the global market portfolio and the currency
deposit index were estimated in sterling to be  im  1.0593 and  ix  0.6036, the
equilibrium expected rate of return in sterling with the CI-GCAPM is
E(Ri)  0.00515625  1.0593[0.00589]  0.6036[ÿ0.000136]  0.01131 per month, or
about 13.57% annualized. Thus the annualized required rate of return in sterling is
about 13.57%, compared to the 11.76% annualized required rate of return in US
dollars.
Suppose the CI-GCAPM reflects actual risk-pricing in financial markets, but one
tries to estimate the asset's cost of equity in sterling with the single-factor GCAPM. A
univariate regression of GrandMet's returns on the global market portfolio, with
monthly returns in sterling between June 1991 and March 1997, would have yielded a
beta estimate of 0.9584. If one somehow estimated the `true' risk premium in sterling
on the global market portfolio, 0.00589, from historical data, one would estimate a
cost of equity in sterling of 0.00515625  0.9584[0.00589]  0.0108, or about 12.96%
annualized, 61 basis points lower than the assumed-true equilibrium expected rate of
return in sterling of 13.57%.
3c. CI-GCAPM versus single-factor GCAPM: discussion
Given that equilibrium expected returns are consistent with the CI-GCAPM in the
illustration, the single-factor GCAPM provided a better approximation of GrandMet's `true' cost of equity in US dollars than in sterling. One reason for the
discrepancy may be that even though the CI-GCAPM can be applied in any
currency, the same is not generally true of the single-factor GCAPM. If the singlefactor GCAPM is assumed to hold in US dollars, then in sterling a two-factor model
holds, where the first factor is the (nominal return on the) global market portfolio in

sterling and the second factor is the percentage change in the sterling price of the US
dollar. 9
Given that the US dollar is the most influential currency, the single-factor GCAPM
may be a better approximation in US dollars than in other currencies. Perhaps this
situation explains why the single-factor GCAPM gives a poorer approximation for
GrandMet's cost of equity in sterling than in US dollars in the illustration, given that
the CI-GCAPM is assumed to hold.

4. On converting an asset's required return between currencies
Some textbooks and articles in the practitioner literature have suggested the use of
nominal risk free interest rate differentials to convert an asset's required return across
currencies. The nominal riskless interest rate differential is a portion of the proper
adjustment, but more is involved. The example above provides a setting to
demonstrate this issue. 10
Recall from the example that GrandMet's (monthly) equilibrium expected rate of
return was estimated to be 1.131% (13.57% annually) in sterling, and 0.98%
(11.76% annually) in US dollars, based on the CI-GCAPM pricing of systematic
market and currency risks. The nominal riskfree rates are 0.515625% (6.1875%
annually) in sterling and 0.46875% (5.625% annually) in US dollars. Thus
GrandMet's monthly required return differential across currencies is about
0.151% (1.81% annually), but the riskfree interest rate differential is considerably
smaller, 0.046875% (0.5625% annually). Thus the difference between the asset's
equilibrium expected rates of return in US dollars and sterling reflects more than the
interest rate differential.
In the CI-GCAPM, the equilibrium expected rate of return on an asset in currency
k, E(Rik), can be converted to the equilibrium expected rate of return in currency kp via
equation (4).
E(Ri )  E(Rik )  r ÿ rk  km [E(Rm ) ÿ r]  kx [E(Rx ) ÿ r]  cov(Rik, xk )

(4)

In equation (4), the required return conversion across currencies depends in part on
the nominal riskless interest rate differential, r ÿ rk. But the conversion also depends
on an adjustment for the systematic risks of the kp=k exchange rate, which determine,
along with the nominal riskless interest rate differential, the equilibrium expected rate
of change in the kp price of currency k, E(xk), in equation (2). Moreover, the
9
This situation results from an accounting transformation from one currency to the other, as
pointed out in Ross and Walsh (1983). The single-factor GCAPM results for any currency only
in the special case when utility is logarithmic, as recognized by Jorion and Schwartz (1986).
However, the estimated market price of risk used here, based on Stulz (1995c), is not consistent
with the assumption of logarithmic utility and its relative risk aversion of 1.
10

The point of this section is recognized in Sercu and Uppal (1995). Our purpose here is to use
the example of the previous section to reinforce the point, and to further discuss the issue that
we think is not yet widely understood. It is convenient to make this point using the CI-GCAPM
illustration, but the result is perfectly general: adjusting an asset's equilibrium expected rate of
return across currencies with the riskless interest rate differential is inconsistent with all
international capital asset pricing models.

15

conversion depends on the covariance of the asset's return in currency k with the
change in the value of currency k, cov(Rik, xk). 11
In order to illustrate equation (4), the betas of the $=£ exchange rate percentage
changes ( km and kx) are estimated with a bivariate regression of the monthly
percentage changes of the exchange rate against the global market portfolio and
currency index, in US dollars. These betas for the June 1991 through March 1997
period were 0.0992 for km and 0.9792 for kx. The covariance between GrandMet's
monthly sterling returns and the monthly percentage changes in the US dollar value of
sterling, cov(Rik, xk), was ÿ0.00037 during the same period.
Given these data, and given the expected monthly rate of return of 0.01131
in sterling, the application of equation (4) results in an equilibrium monthly
expected rate of return on GrandMet's stock in US dollars of E(Ri ) 
0.01131  0.0046875 ÿ 0.00515625  0.0992[0.0045]  0.979[ÿ0.00131]  (ÿ0.00037) 
0.00963, or 0.963% monthly (11.56% annually). This estimate of the US dollar
required return from equation (4) is much closer to the rate found with the CIGCAPM in US dollars, 0.98% (11.76% annually), than the rate found with the
interest rate adjustment 1.084% (13% annually). 12
5. Conclusion
The CI-GCAPM, which includes a currency index factor in addition to the global
market factor, may be a useful tool in practitioner valuations of assets in globally
integrated markets. The model is more easily implemented than the general multicurrency version of the international CAPM and is more consistent with empirical
evidence of the pricing of systematic exposure to exchange rate changes than the
single-factor GCAPM.
The application of the model is illustrated on an asset with parameters estimated
from historical data, and a comparison is made with the single-factor GCAPM. The
numerical results of this exercise are also used to illustrate the fallacy of adjusting an
asset's required rate of return across currencies via the nominal riskless interest rate
differential.

Equation (4) is derived from the Ito approximation to converting returns,

the Ito approximation (see footnote 7) had been used to convert exchange rates and returns, as
assumed in the model. In the application here, actual conversions were made in order to gauge
the impact of that approximation.

Appendix
In international capital asset pricing theory, investors from different nations realize
different real returns from a given security when purchasing power parity does not
hold. Despite the heterogeneity in real returns, equilibrium asset pricing can be
achieved under the assumption of fully integrated international currency and capital
markets that meet typical perfect markets conditions. The K-country international
CAPM includes K  1 risk premia, one for the global portfolio of risky assets, one for
the valuation currency's own inflation risk, and K ÿ 1 additional risk factors
corresponding to each other country's uncertain inflation, expressed in the pricing
currency, kp. Foreign inflation rates expressed in kp have two components: inflation in
the foreign currency and the percentage change in the exchange rate between the
foreign currency and kp. With this model, a consistent value of any asset can be found
from the viewpoint of any currency. 13
A convenient additional assumption is that each country's inflation rate is
nonstochastic when measured in its own currency. This situation has been called
the Solnik-Sercu special case. Here there is no inflation risk premium for the pricing
currency, kp, and the other K ÿ 1 risk premia apply to nominal foreign exchange risks.
In this case, asset i can be valued in terms of any currency kp by the following nominal
pricing relationship:
E(Ri )  r  q cov(Ri, Rm )  k 6 kpq(1=qk ÿ 1)wk cov(Ri, xk )=W

(A1)

where Ri, r, Rm, and xk are expressed in currency kp,
Ri is the return on asset i, consisting of the asset's local currency return and the change
in the value of the asset's currency relative to currency kp,
r is the riskfree rate in currency kp,
Rm is the return in currency kp on the unhedged global market portfolio,
xk is the percentage change of currency k relative to currency kp,
wk is the wealth of country k,
qk is the market average degree of risk aversion of investors from country k,
W is global wealth and equals kwk, and
1=q is the global harmonic mean degree of risk aversion, equal to (kwk=qk )=W.
Equation (A1) says that the required return on an asset is the risk free rate plus a
risk premium for exposure to the global market portfolio, plus K ÿ 1 risk premia for
exposure to each of the K ÿ 1 exchange rates relative to the currency of valuation. The
coefficients of the K covariance terms sum to unity and the choice of valuation
currency is irrelevant for equation (A1).

The K ÿ 1 currency risk factors may be aggregated into a portfolio. The exact
weights of this portfolio are generally unobservable, but may not be critical to
practitioners, who are likely to use a proxy currency index anyway. Under the
assumption of equal aggregate risk tolerances across borders, the currency index
weights are relative national wealth. Although risk tolerances may not be empirically
equal across investors or across borders, and although wealth weights are not
necessarily consistent with the trade-weighted currency index used in the application
in the text, this assumption is employed below as the easiest way to show how the
currency factors collapse into an index portfolio.
The assumption of equal degrees of aggregate risk aversion across borders, qk  
for all k, implies that q from equation (A1) also takes the value . Thus, equation (A1)
reduces to a risk-pricing model in only two factors:
E(Ri )  r   cov(Ri, Rm )  (1 ÿ )cov(Ri, X )

(A2)

where
X is a wealth-weighted index of the percent changes in all other currencies,
k 6 kpwkxk=W, in terms of the currency of valuation (kp). Equivalently, X is the
percentage change in a wealth-weighted index of exchange rates.
A key step in the derivation of equation (1) in the text is the application of equation
(A2) to Rm and Rx to obtain:
E(Rm ) ÿ r   var(Rm )  (1 ÿ )cov(Rm, X ),

(A3a)

E(Rx ) ÿ r   cov(X, Rm )  (1 ÿ )var(X ).

(A3b)

Equation (1) in the text then follows from solving equations (A3a) and (A3b)
simultaneously for  and (1 ÿ ), substituting the results into equation (A2), and
rearranging. equations (3a) and (3b) in the text follow directly from equations (A3a)
and (A3b), noting that the only variation in Rx is variation in X.
