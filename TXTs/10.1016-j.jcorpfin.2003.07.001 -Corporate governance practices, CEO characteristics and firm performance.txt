Abstract
This paper examines the link between firm performance, CEO characteristics and changes in
corporate governance practices using an unbalanced panel of 1721 firms from 1980 to 1995. This
paper provides the stylized facts about corporate governance practices and details how governance
practices have evolved over time. By 1995, the majority of firms had implemented differing types of
charter amendments, poison pills or other governance provisions that are potentially harmful to
shareholders. Most firms have adopted multiple and even redundant governance provisions.
Shareholders are more likely to approve an increase in the power of the boards of directors of better
performing firms, while the boards of poorly performing firms are much more likely to initiate
governance changes, such as poison pills, that circumvent shareholder approval. I find no
relationship between CEO age, tenure or compensation and governance changes.

Despite a great deal of interest by institutional investors and others in the area of
corporate governance, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence linking firm performance with changes in governance practices. In this paper, I take a fresh look at the effect
of firm performance and CEO characteristics on corporate governance practices, acknowledging the endogenous nature of this relationship. An understanding of corporate
governance requires knowledge of the interrelationships among governance practices.
To this end, I examine a panel of 1721 large US firms tracked by the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (IRRC). This panel spans 1980 – 1995 and contains

information on each firm’s charter and bylaw provisions, existence of a poison pill, other
governance features (e.g., cumulative voting, confidential voting, golden parachutes),
applicable state anti-takeover laws and board composition data, combined with performance and accounting data from CRSP and Compustat.
This paper has three main objectives. First, it provides a workable definition of
corporate governance that can be used to structure empirical analysis. I begin by defining
corporate governance as a set of constraints on managers and shareholders as they bargain
to determine how the value of the firm will be allocated. Since the value of the firm’s
shares represents the present value of the shareholder’s allocation of firm value, under this
definition, corporate governance can be thought of as a set of constraints imposed on firm
performance. Within the context of this definition, I contend that corporate governance
practices will have the largest observable effects on firm performance when these
constraints become binding.
Second, I identify stylized facts about corporate governance and detail how governance
practices have evolved over time.1 For example, by 1995, over 72% of the firms in my
sample had implemented at least one charter amendment that potentially could constrain
shareholder wealth. Within this subset, the average number of charter amendments
adopted was 2.54 per firm. Likewise, by 1995, over 53% of the firms in my sample
had adopted poison pills. Additionally, over 81% of firms in my sample in 1995 have
golden parachutes in place for top management, while less than 12% have adopted a policy
of confidential voting and less than 15% have adopted a policy allowing for cumulative
voting. Furthermore, I document that multiple governance provisions that potentially
could harm shareholders exist in a large number of sample firms. Many of these
governance provisions are redundant. Therefore, the adoption or removal of individual
governance practices may have little impact on firm performance, if they do not change the
nature of the constraints on future shareholder bargaining.
Finally, I examine the endogenous relationship between corporate governance practices, CEO characteristics and long-term performance. I argue that changes in the
governance practices of firms could be the result of a bargaining process between
managers, boards of directors and shareholders, and that the bargaining strength of the
parties is a function of the CEOs tenure and the firm’s prior performance. I examine longterm performance measures surrounding governance changes and document that firms
adopting governance changes requiring a shareholder vote typically significantly outperform benchmark portfolios for the 1, 2, 3 and 5 years prior to adoption. Likewise, I
document that firms adopting poison pills, which do not require shareholder votes,
significantly under-perform benchmark portfolios for the 1, 2, 3 and 5 years prior to
adoption. These results are confirmed in a set of multivariate logistic regressions, which
demonstrate that prior firm performance is significant variable in determining the firm’s
choice between adopting a poison pill or charter amendments. While the performance
results are consistent with a bargaining story, I find no apparent relationship between the
governance changes and the CEOs’ age, tenure or measures of CEO compensation. These
CEO results are inconsistent with CEO bargaining for governance changes.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 1 provides the motivation for this paper and
an overview of the current literature; Section 2 details the data used in the analysis and
provides some descriptive statistics; Section 3 presents stylized facts about governance
practices in the panel; Section 4 provides an analysis of CEO age, tenure and compensation surrounding governance changes, while Section 5 examines long-term performance
surrounding governance changes; and Section 6 provides a multivariate analysis of
governance changes in a logit framework. Finally, Section 7 summarizes my conclusions.

1. Motivation and overview of the current literature
Recently, there has been a great deal of interest by institutional investors and others in
the area of corporate governance. The increased role of indexing has led many institutions
to become active in trying to influence the corporate governance policies of the firms in
their portfolio. This institutional activism appears to be based upon the belief that
governance practices influence subsequent firm performance,2 although there is actually
surprisingly little evidence linking governance practices with subsequent firm performance.
Most analyses of the relationship between governance and performance rely on some
changes in the governance practices of the firm with many authors examining the effect on
performance following these changes. These studies fall into two categories: (1) studies
that examine the initiation of ‘‘anti-takeover’’ provisions, and (2) studies that examine
activist institutional investors who attempt to influence firms to change governance
practices. Studies that examine the wealth effects surrounding the initiation of ‘‘antitakeover’’ provisions in firms’ governance practices offer mixed results. Typically, they
use event studies to examine abnormal returns surrounding the announcement of
governance changes. However, there are problems with this methodology. First, many
governance changes (such as anti-takeover charter amendments) are announced in the
firms’ proxy statements that usually contain a host of other information that potentially
contaminate the results. Second, as discussed by Brickley et al. (1988), abnormal returns
surrounding the announcement of an anti-takeover governance practice have three separate
components.3 More importantly, any abnormal return associated with the features’
adoption will be the future cost to shareholders if the constraint becomes binding,
discounted by both the probability of the constraint becoming binding and the firm’s
discount rate. The impact of this discounting may be sufficient to preclude finding
statistically significant results. With the above caveats in mind, Bhagat and Brickley
(1984), Jarrell and Poulsen (1987), Malatesta and Walkling (1988) and Comment and
Schwert (1995) find that the adoption of governance practices that deter takeovers appear
to produce negative returns. On the other hand, studies by DeAngelo and Rice (1983),
Jarrell and Poulsen (1987) and Linn and McConnell (1983) offer evidence of zero or even
2

See Biggs (1996).
The first component is the increased likelihood that a firm adopting the governance practice will be a
takeover target. It is assumed that management’s timing in seeking the governance changes contains information
about the likelihood of a takeover. The second component is the likelihood of an increased premium conditional
on a successful offer. The third component is the decreased likelihood of an offer being successful.
3

positive returns. Studies that examine wealth effects following actions by institutional
investors typically fail to find any positive wealth or performance effects related to
targeting of governance issues.4 This lack of convincing evidence may be related to the
limited scope of the activist institution’s targeting or to the limitations of the methodologies used.
The popular view of governance changes has been that CEOs force upon shareholders
various governance changes that serve to protect and entrench management by constraining the power of shareholders. This view ignores the fact that many of these governance
changes require shareholder approval to be implemented. To the extent that governance
changes are wealth decreasing to shareholders, shareholders would be acting irrationally in
voting with management on such proposals. In examining the performance – governance
relationship, the question I seek to answer in this paper is: Why do shareholders agree to
adopt governance changes that could potentially harm them?
A potential explanation for why shareholders would agree to adopt potentially harmful
changes can be inferred from the work of Hermalin and Weisbach (1998), who develop a
model to explain how CEOs bargain for board composition based upon the CEO’s
perceived ability. The intuition of their model can be extended to a bargaining model
between the CEO and shareholders. The CEO and shareholders will bargain for the
allocation of firm value and for constraints on the shareholders’ future bargaining power.
The bargaining position of the CEO is a function of the shareholders’ confidence in the
CEO’s ability as proxied by prior firm performance.
In the spirit of Zingales (1997), I define corporate governance as the set of constraints
on managers and shareholders as they bargain for the distribution of firm value. In
developing a definition of corporate governance, I begin with a corporation that has
various stakeholders, each with differing objectives. The initial contracts will not fully
allocate all of the firm value and thus stakeholders must bargain for the residual value.
Each stakeholder’s objective is to maximize the present value of her allocation of the
expected future value of the firm. In this regard, the stakeholders will concern themselves
not only with the present allocation of firm value, but also with their bargaining power in
future allocation decisions. Therefore, the various stakeholders bargain not only for the
allocation of firm value, but also for constraints on the future bargaining power of the other
stakeholders. I therefore define the governance structure of a firm as a continuum of
constraints on managers, boards of directors and shareholders.
With this definition of corporate governance, and the implicit assumption that shareholders gain utility only through the return on their shares, firm performance becomes
equivalent to the shareholder’s allocation of firm value. I view management’s bargaining
strength in the allocation of firm value as a function of both management tenure and prior
firm performance. Hence, good performance will add to the bargaining strength of
managers, who might choose to use this strength to add new constraints on the future
allocations of firm value.

For example, Karpoff et al. (1996), Smith (1996), Wahal (1996), Strickland et al. (1996) and Carleton et al.
(1998) fail to offer convincing evidence of performance improvements or positive wealth effects for institutional
activism on governance issues. For an excellent review of this literature, see Karpoff (1998).

2. The data
I examine an unbalanced panel of 1721 firms from 1980 to 1995, a total of 22,776 firm
year observations, which contains the provisions from the firm’s charter and bylaws,
information about the adoption of poison pills (shareholder’s rights plans) and other
governance features (i.e., cumulative voting, confidential voting, golden parachutes,
reincorporating, opting out of state anti-takeover laws, etc.), information regarding the
applicable laws from the state of incorporation and information detailing the composition
of the board of directors. I combine this governance data with performance and accounting
data from CRSP and Compustat. The governance features of each firm in the sample were
tracked by the Investor Responsibility Research Center. The firms selected by the IRRC,
and hence my sample firms, tend to be large widely held companies. Table 1 provides
descriptive statistics on the number and size of the sample firms from 1980 to 1995.
Details of the firms’ charter provisions, adoption of shareholder rights plans and other
governance features come from a series of books published by the Investor Responsibility
Research Center entitled Corporate Takeover Defenses. Each volume of Corporate
Takeover Defenses contains detailed information on the governance practices of 1500
firms. Volumes from 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1995 were used to construct the sample in this
paper. The 1721 firms in this sample result from the intersection of the US firms included
in the IRRC volumes and the firms contained in the Center for Research in Security Prices
(CRSP) and Standard & Poor’s Compustat databases.
The IRRC data provides a snapshot of each firms’ governance practices as of June 30th
of the year of the particular volume. In most cases, the IRRC provides the year in which

individual governance features were adopted. In many of the cases, where the adoption
year is absent, it was possible to determine a range of years when a governance feature was
in place by comparing the firm’s governance features across volumes. In other cases,
proxy statements are used to identify missing years of adoption. Overall, I have been able
to identify over 90% of the adoption years for charter and bylaw provisions. In instances
where I have not identified the year of adoption, the most likely reason is that the provision
was included either in the articles of incorporation or re-incorporation.
Each IRRC volume also provides data on 16 other governance features that may not
necessarily be part of the firms’ charter or bylaws. These features include the adoption of
confidential voting, cumulative voting, golden parachutes and any re-incorporation or
action to opt out of state anti-takeover laws. The IRRC also includes the existence of and
any action regarding poison pills (shareholder rights plans).
Board composition data are collected from a series of CD-ROMs published by
Disclosure Incorporated. These data begin in 1987 and are limited to classifying directors
as either insiders or outsiders. Any analysis relying on board composition will be
significantly limited since this classification does not include a category for ‘‘gray’’
directors.5 I classify directors based upon the title provided on the Disclosure CD-ROMs.
CEO age, tenure and compensation data are collected from the Forbes annual CEO
compensation issues. The data for 1980 to 1988 are from Jensen and Murphy’s (1990) data
set, while data for 1989 to 1995 were gathered directly from Forbes. The panel contains
the CEO’s age, tenure as CEO, tenure with the firm, salary, bonus, stock gains, other
compensation and stock ownership. The Forbes data covers 10,396 (45.6%) of the 22,776
observations in the full panel.
Information regarding the applicable laws from the state of incorporation comes from
two books published by the IRRC. The first, State Takeover Laws: A State by State Guide,
provides detailed information on eight different types of takeover laws and a detailed
description of the provisions from each state as well as the date that each law went into
effect. The second, Corporate Governance State by State: A Guide to Selected Statutes
presents information on 11 separate issues in corporate law. Six of these issues are tracked
in my database. Since this guide provides the current status of corporate law, and not the
effective dates for the statutes, the annotated statutes of each state were reviewed to
determine the effective years for each statute.
Determination of the actual governance features of a firm requires detailed information
on the firm’s charter and bylaw provisions, combined with information from the statutes of
the state of incorporation. The shareholders of a firm incorporated in Delaware, for example,
cannot cumulate their votes for directors unless the firm’s charter specifically allows for
cumulative voting, while shareholders of firms incorporated in Pennsylvania are allowed to
cumulate their votes unless the firm’s charter specifically denies cumulative voting.6
Likewise, a Delaware firm will not have a classified board unless the firms bylaws or
charter provide otherwise.7 Therefore, if you are interested in classified boards or cumulative

voting as a governance feature, examining the firm’s charter or bylaws is insufficient to
determine the governance features of the firm.
My database tracks a total of 13 separate provisions from the firms’ charters, nine
separate bylaw provisions, six different classes of state takeover laws and six separate
features of state corporate law.8 A glossary of governance provisions is provided in
Appendix A to explain each of the governance features in my database.

3. Cross-sectional examination of governance practices
By 1995, of 1403 firms in my sample, 1074 (76.6%) have adopted one or more charter
amendments, 300 (21.4%) have adopted one or more bylaw provisions, 746 (53.2%) had
poison pills in place and 1318 (93.9%) were covered by at least one state anti-takeover
law. For comparison, in 1980 of 1138 firms in my sample, only 103 (9.1%) had adopted
one or more charter amendments, 20 (1.8%) had adopted one or more bylaws provisions
and no firms had poison pills in place or were covered by any state anti-takeover laws.
This trend may be important, since governance practices have the potential to constrain
shareholder wealth.9,10
I divide governance practices into three categories: governance features, charter amendments and state anti-takeover laws. The first category, governance features, is essentially a
catchall category that contains features that are determined through a combination of state
law, charter amendments, bylaw provisions and other actions by the board of directors. In
1980, for example, 53.9% of firms limit the ability of shareholders to call special meetings.
This high percentage is the result of many state incorporation codes that do not provide this
right to shareholders. By 1995, 69.6% of firms limited the shareholders ability to call
special meetings, an increase primarily resulting from changes to the firms’ charters and
bylaws. The second category, charter amendments, represents provisions that are essentially
independent of the statutes of the state of incorporation. Finally, the state anti-takeover laws
category represents the percentage of firms incorporated in states with anti-takeover statutes
that have not elected to ‘‘opt out’’ of the state law coverage.
A breakdown of basic governance features by year is provided in Table 2. Where in 1980,
it was the exception for a firm to utilize any of the various governance provisions, by 1995,
such provisions were the norm. The use of classified boards, for example, has increased from
only 9.5% of firms in 1980 to 59.9% in 1995. Likewise, the prevalence of golden parachutes
increased from less that 1% to over 81% and the prevalence of poison pills have increased
from 0% to over 53% over the 16 years covered by the sample. By 1995, a majority of firms
had classified boards, poison pills and golden parachutes, and where protected by fair price
8
One particular charter provision, the ability to issue so called ‘‘blank check preferred stock’’, is tracked in
my database, however, it is often difficult to determine the effective year of this particular type of provision.
9
The following types of charter and bylaw provisions were considered in this analysis: antigreenmail,
classified board, dual class common stock, elimination of cumulative voting, fair price, limited ability to amend
bylaws or charter, limited action by written consent, limited ability to call special meetings, consideration of nonfinancial effects of mergers, supermajority to approve mergers and unequal voting rights.
10
The following types of state anti-takeover laws were considered in this analysis: cash out, control share
acquisition, directors’ duties, freeze out, fair price and profit recapture statutes.

This table provides a breakdown of the percentage of firms that have various governance features in 1980, 1985,
1987, 1990, 1993 and 1995. The governance features section represents the interactions between the laws of the
state of incorporation with the firm’s charter and bylaw provisions. The charter provisions section details the
various charter provisions that do not interact with the laws from the state of incorporation. The state anti-takeover

charter provisions, limitations on the ability to call shareholder meetings, and state freeze out
laws. A small minority of sample firms adopted provisions that were clearly beneficial to
shareholders, with only 16.1% adopting antigreenmail, 11.5% adopting confidential voting
and 22.8% adopting cumulative voting by 1995.
There is also a noticeable trend toward governance features relating to, or empowering,
the boards of directors. Most state anti-takeover laws provide enormous power to the
boards of directors to reject unfriendly acquisitions. Poison pills and non-financial effects
of merger provisions also add significant power to the boards, and the increase in classified
board provisions and the decrease in cumulative voting can make it more difficult for
shareholders to change the composition of the board in a timely manner. In 1995, over
97% of sample firms were covered by at least one governance provision whose effect is
contingent on a vote from the board of directors.11 Therefore, I contend that the single
11
Here, I consider poison pills, non-financial effects of merger provisions, cash out statutes, control share
acquisition statutes, director’s duties statutes, fair price provisions and statutes, freeze out statutes and profit
recapture statutes.

most important governance variable is likely to be the composition of the board of
directors, and that the impact of many other governance provisions must be conditioned on
board composition.12
Also of interest in Table 2 is the apparent clustering in time of various governance
provisions. Over 85% of sample firms adopting poison pills, for example, do so during the
5-year window from 1986 to 1990. Similarly, most coverage from state anti-takeover laws
occurs during the same period. The adoptions also tend to be correlated with the market for
corporate control. The correlation between a binary dummy variable for poison pill
adoptions is significantly positively correlated with both the total number of bids
(q=0.06536, p value=0.0001) and the number of hostile bids during the previous year
(q=0.17369, p value=0.0001).13
The contemporaneous relationships between governance provisions are detailed in
Table 3. Given a sub-sample of firms with any given governance provision, this table
provides the percentage of firms having additional types of provisions. It is apparent from
Table 3 that most firms have multiple governance provisions in place. For firms that have
adopted poison pills, for example, 71% also have classified boards, 63% are covered by a
fair price provision and over 92% have a golden parachute in place for the CEO. Although
many of the measures may appear to be substitutes one another, firms early to adopt new
provisions may have adopted multiple provisions as added protection until sufficient case
law was established to ensure the legality of these measures. I find that of firms initiating
changes to their governance provisions, firms in the first half of the sample adopted
significantly more provisions at the same time than firms adopting latter in the sample.14
Another possible explanation for this result is the prevalence of state anti-takeover laws
resulted in a diminished demand for new firm level provisions. Regardless, there still
appears to be a large amount of redundancy in provisions. Over 33% of firms covered by a
fair price statute, for example, also have a fair price provision in their charter.
Another interesting result from Table 3 comes from examining the sub-sample of firms
that limit the shareholders ability to amend either the charter or the bylaws. For firms that
limit the ability to amend the charter, 81% have classified boards, 76% are covered by fair
price provisions, 74% have limits on the ability to call special meetings, 50% have adopted
a supermajority rule to approve mergers and 67% have adopted restrictions on the ability
to amend the bylaws. I find no firms in the sample that limit the ability to amend the
charter prior to the adoption of at least one anti-takeover provision. In fact, firms that limit

12
Although the boards of directors are supposed to represent the interests of the shareholders, this may not
always be the case. Boards may be acting in the shareholder interests when adopting anti-takeover measures is the
intent is to increase the premium to the shareholders in the event of a takeover. The boards may, however, be
acting to increase their own power or, to the extent that the board isn’t fully independent of the management, they
may be acting to the CEO’s benefit.
13
I construct these measures using the SDC mergers and acquisitions database.
14
For the 969 firms with adoptions prior to 1988, the mean (median) number of adoptions was 1.78 (1.00)
compared to the mean (median) 1.38 (1.00) for the 892 adoptions latter in the sample. Both a two-sample t test
and non-parametric median test show a significantly (at better than a 1% level) larger number of simultaneous
new adoptions in the earlier half of the sample period. In this analysis, I considered new charter amendments, new
bylaw provisions and the adoption of poison pills.

the ability to amend the charter have a mean (median) of 2.77 (3.00) additional charter
amendments in place.
The contemporaneous relationships between various governance changes and the
overall set of governance features following these changes are summarized in Table 4.
The adoption of redundant provisions is apparent when examining the results of Table
4. Eleven percent of firms already covered by a fair price statute choose to add a fair
price provision to their charters, and 8.8% of firms already covered by a director’s
duties statute choose to add non-financial effects of merger provision to their charters.
Overall, 37.8% of firms covered by a fair price statute, and 7.7% of firms covered by
a director’s duty statute have redundant provisions in their charters. This redundancy
may influence the results of empirical studies that examine the adoption or removal of
governance features. To the extent that governance features are redundant, their
adoption or removal will not change the constraints imposed on shareholders, and
hence should have little impact on firm performance. Another interesting observation
from the table is that firms with provisions that are potentially beneficial to shareholders (antigreenmail, cumulative voting and confidential voting) in place are less
likely to subsequently or simultaneously adopt provisions that are potentially harmful
to shareholders.
The contemporaneous relationships between governance changes are summarized in
Table 5. There are several results of interest that can be gleaned from this table. First, it is
apparent that many firms tend to adopt multiple charter amendments simultaneously. In
fact, of firms amending their charters, 43% adopt two or more and 23% adopt three or
more charter amendments simultaneously. For example, conditional on a firm adopting an
amendment limiting the ability to amendment the charter, 40% of firms simultaneously
adopt classified board amendments, 45% simultaneously adopt fair price amendments,
80% simultaneously adopt amendments limiting the ability to amend the bylaws, 40%
simultaneously adopt amendments limiting action by written consent, 30% simultaneously
limit the ability to call special meetings and 45% simultaneously adopt supermajority to
approve a merger amendments. This supports the findings from Table 3 that suggest that
firms place limits on the ability to amend their charter only after multiple anti-takeover
measures are in place.
Another interesting result from Table 5 is that a classified board charter amendment
seems to be a commonly adopted simultaneously with most of the anti-takeover charter
amendments. Classified boards are adopted simultaneously in over 40% of cases where
fair price, limited ability to amend bylaws, limited ability to amend charter, limited action
by consent, limited ability to call meetings, non-financial effects of merger and supermajority to approve merger amendments are adopted. The classified board may be the single
most powerful governance feature since it is the board of directors that control how the
other governance provisions will be implemented. A supermajority to approve a merger
charter amendment, for example, forces a supermajority vote of the shareholders only if
the board does not approve the merger. For the CEO to benefit from these governance
changes, the CEO would have to influence the board or co-opt the board’s independence.
If the CEO has been successful in co-opting the board, then a classified board would allow
the CEO to maintain control of the firm for a longer period of time following a hostile
attempt to takeover the firm.

One final observation from Table 5 is that very view firms adopting poison pills
simultaneously add amendments to their charters. Classified board amendments were the
most popular charter amendment made simultaneously with the adoption of poison pills,
with only 6.2% of poison pill adopters adding a classified board. This 6.2% is relatively
low compared to charter amendments where classified boards were adopted simultaneously in over 40% of the cases. This is a curious result since the board of directors typically
has significant power in determining if and how the poison pill is implemented. Overall, in
the sub-sample of firms adopting either charter amendments or poison pills, there is a
significant negative correlation between the adoption of poison pills and the adoption of
charter amendments.15 One possible explanation for this result is that charter amendments
and poison pills are substitutes for one another and adoption of both would be redundant.
However, the results from Table 3 suggest that at least by 1995, most firms having poison
pills also had multiple anti-takeover charter provisions, and most firms with anti-takeover
charter provisions also had poison pills. An alternative explanation is that boards choose
between charter amendments and poison pills based upon their perceived bargaining
strength relative to the shareholders. This would imply that, since charter amendments
require a shareholder vote, charter amendments would be placed on the firms’ proxy for a
vote when the boards felt that they had relatively high bargaining capital relative to the
shareholders, and likewise, boards would unilaterally implement poison pills when they
felt that they had insufficient bargaining capital. This explanation will be examined in
greater detail in Section 6.

4. CEO AGE, tenure and compensation surrounding governance changes
To the extent that a CEO’s reputation, and hence his bargaining strength, might be
related to his tenure, I analyze the distribution of the CEO’s tenure both at the position of
CEO and with the firm. The results from this analysis are provided in Table 6. Does CEO
tenure affect the initiation of governance changes? If the CEO’s tenure were positively
correlated with his bargaining strength, then I would expect to find a smaller number of
governance changes initiated in firms with newer CEOs.
To test this hypothesis, I first calculate the lower decile and quartile cutoffs of CEO
tenure for the entire sample. I then calculate the percentage of firms with a governance
change where the CEO’s tenure is less than or equal to the value of the lower decile
(quartile) from the entire sample. Finally, I perform, but do not report, a series of binomial
tests to compare this percentage to the percentage of low tenure CEOs from the entire
sample. These tests use both tenure as CEO and tenure with the firm. Binomial tests for
each type of governance change individual, as well as a joint test across governance
changes, fails to support the hypothesis that CEO tenure is related to the likelihood of the
initiation of governance changes.
15
Here, I construct two dummy variables to account for new charter amendments and new poison pills.
When a new charter amendment or poison pill is adopted the variable is set to +1, if there is no adoption then the
variable is set to 1. The correlation between the charter and poison pill variables is 0.89187 with a p value of
0.0001.

Distribution of CEO age surrounding
governance changes
N

This table provides several percentile breakpoints for the tenure as CEO and the CEO’s age based conditional
upon various governance changes. The breakdown for the entire sample of 10,396 firms for which tenure data is
available is provided at the bottom of the table. Binomial tests fail to support the hypothesis that CEO’s that
initiate governance changes are less likely to have lower tenure when compared to the tenure of CEOs in the
entire sample.

The present value that a CEO derives from a governance change is a function of the
number of years the CEO remains as CEO. The longer the CEO is in power, the higher the
expected value to the CEO of a governance feature that constrains shareholders. Since the
expected value of a governance change should be lower in older CEOs, who are closer to
retirement, I expect to find fewer governance changes initiated in firms with older CEOs. I
also examine the distribution of CEO age during the initiation of governance changes in
Table 6. To test the hypothesis that older CEOs initiate fewer governance changes, I
calculate the upper decile and quartile values of the CEO age for the entire sample and
then calculate the percentage of firms that initiate a governance change, where the CEO’s
age is greater than or equal to the upper decile or quartile values for the entire sample.

Finally, I perform, but do not report, a series of binomial tests to compare this percentage
to the percentage from the entire sample. The binomial tests for each type of governance
change individual, as well as a joint test across governance changes, fail to support the
hypothesis that older CEOs are less likely to initiate governance changes.16
It is important, however, to realize that these governance changes do not directly
empower the CEO, but increase the powers of the Board of Directors. It is possible that,
while CEO tenure and other CEO characteristics do not appear to influence the adoption of
changes in the governance provisions of the firm, CEO characteristics may play an
important role in determining how the boards utilize these new found powers. For the CEO
to benefit from these changes, the CEO would have to influence the board or co-opt the
board’s independence.
There are several reasons to expect that the initiation of governance changes may be
related to CEO compensation. First, if governance changes are the result of a bargaining
process between the CEO and shareholders, then the CEO may substitute a portion of his
current compensation in exchange for the initiation of a governance change. Second, if
these governance provisions entrench management, we expect to see an increase in
compensation following the initiation of governance changes.
Panel A of Table 7 shows the percentage change in total CEO compensation
surrounding governance changes. Total CEO compensation comes from the Forbes’
compensation surveys and is defined as salary+bonus+other compensation+stock gains.
In a joint test across governance changes, the mean change in total compensation varies
from 34.0% to 40.1% and the median change varies between 10.9% and 13.2% for the
years surrounding the governance change.
In Panel B of Table 7, I examine CEO pay for performance surrounding governance
changes. CEO pay for performance is the ratio of total CEO compensation to the increase
in shareholder wealth. As shown in the table, CEO pay for performance reflects the
amount of total CEO compensation for every US$1000 increase in shareholder wealth. In
a joint test across governance changes, the median pay for performance declines from
US$1.65 per US$1000 the year prior to governance changes to US$1.26 in the year
following governance changes.
Panel C of Table 7 examines CEO pay for performance sensitivity. CEO pay for
performance sensitivity measures the dollar change in CEO compensation per US$1000
increase in shareholder wealth.17 In a joint test across governance changes, I document the
median pay for performance sensitivity increases in the year that governance changes are
initiated. Overall, the results from Table 7 are inconsistent with the notion that CEOs
forgo current compensation in exchange for the initiation of governance changes.
Additionally, these results suggest that CEOs do not extract higher compensation following
the adoption of governance changes. It is possible, however, that these governance changes
enhance the CEO’s job security and this is more valuable to the CEO than higher
compensation.

16
The CEO tenure and age results are robust to analysis on a sub-sample of firms that eliminates
observations corresponding to changes in the CEO.

This table provides the percentage change in CEO compensation, CEO pay for performance and the CEO pay for performance sensitivity for the years surrounding
governance changes. Pay for performance is measured as the dollar amount of total CEO compensation per US$1000 increase in shareholder wealth.
Pay for performance sensitivity is measured as the dollar change in total CEO compensation per US$1000 increase in shareholder wealth. Total compensation is defined as
salary+bonus+other compensation+stock gains and is collected from the Forbes’ CEO compensation Surveys. Other compensation includes payments made under long
term compensation plans, restricted stock awards, company paid health insurance and other benefits. Statistical significance is determined using a simple t test for the
means and a Wilcoxon Sign Rank test for the medians.
* Denotes significance at the 10% level.
** Denotes significance at the 5% level.

5. Long-term performance surrounding governance changes
One-, two-, three- and five-year size/market-to-book-adjusted holding period returns
(HPR) are calculated by compounding monthly returns using the methodology suggested
by Lyon et al. (1999). The size/market-to-book-adjusted returns represent the HPR for a
specific firm minus the return on the size decile portfolio further divided into MTB quintile
portfolios.18 Statistical significance for the means is determined using the bootstrapped t
statistic as suggested by Lyon et al. (1999), due to the distributional properties of these
long term HPRs, standard t test are invalid for testing the significance of the means.19
Additionally, the skewness of the HPR distributions would suggest that the median is a
superior measure of central tendency in conducting an analysis of long term HPRs.
Significance on the medians is determined using Wilcoxon sign-rank tests. As an added
test of significance, the confidence interval approach suggested by Efron and Tibshirani
(1993) and implemented by Elliot and Suay (1999) is used to determine significance of
both the means and medians.20
When examining long horizon returns, there is a question as to whether the mean or
median is the best measure on which to focus. The use of the median allows a
comparison with the ‘‘typical’’ firm rather than the average firm. The median adjusted
holding period returns will be of the most interest in this study. The point of this study is
not to examine issues of market efficiency that rely on the average (mean) firm for
comparison.
Table 8 provides the adjusted holding period returns for the 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year periods
preceding various governance changes. In examining the medians, significantly negative
adjusted HPRs are found prior to the adoption of golden parachutes, poison pills,
confidential voting and cumulative voting. The confidential and cumulative voting results
may be an artifact of institutional activism. Both confidential and cumulative voting were
popular issues targeted by institutional investors in the early 1990s, and many institutional
investors used of prior performance as a selection criteria for targeting might explain these
results.21 It is also noteworthy that golden parachutes and poison pills are the only two
governance features examined that either do not require a shareholder vote or may not be
repealed through a shareholder vote.
Also from Table 8, the median adjusted HPRs for many of the new charter/bylaw
changes appear to be positive. In fact, joint tests on the HPRs for charter/bylaw changes
show the medians to be significantly positive for the 1, 2, 3 and 5 years prior to adoption.
This result is important since charter amendments always require a vote of the shareholders
and bylaws are either approved by shareholders or subject to future revision/retraction by

18
Analysis was also performed (not reported) using size deciles portfolios, MTB decile portfolios and
industry portfolios to calculated excess returns. These results do not differ significantly from those reported using
the combined size/MTB portfolios.
19
A Kolmogorov D statistic was calculated to test for normality of the distributions. In all cases where N
exceeded 50, I was able to reject normality.
20
For a detailed explanation of the methodology used in this approach, see Elliot and Suay (1999).
21
See Wahal (1996).

This table reports the mean (median) abnormal performance for 1, 2, 3 and 5 calendar years prior to various
governance changes. Holding period returns are compounded monthly returns calculated using the methodology
described by Lyon et al. (1999). Returns are adjusted by subtracting off the portfolio returns for combined size and to
book portfolios. First, size portfolios are calculated using NYSE listed firms and then adding back the NASDAQ.
Next, the combined size and market to book portfolios are created using size deciles divided into five separate
portfolios based upon the market to book ratio. Boot-strapped t statistics were calculated for the means using the
methodology Lyon et al. (1999). None of the means is significant at the 10% level or better using this methodology.
The confidence interval methodology of Elliott and Suay is utilized to test significance of both means and
medians. Wilcoxon Sign Rank Tests are used to test the significance of medians.

shareholders. These results suggest that firms tend initiate changes in governance practices
requiring shareholder approval after a period of superior performance.
Although it appears that firms initiating charter or bylaw changes outperform
benchmark portfolios prior to adoption, it is unclear whether these results will differ
based upon whether the change is in the form of a charter amendment or bylaw
provision. The process of amending the charter differs materially from the process used
to change the bylaws. An amendment to the firm’s charter is initiated by the board of
directors and approved by a vote of the shareholders, whereas either the shareholders of
the board of directors may initiate a bylaw change. In 42 of the 50 states, boards of
directors are empowered to amend the bylaws without a shareholder vote.22 In the
remaining eight states, seven allow for a provision in the bylaws or charter that allows
the board to amend the bylaws. Regardless of whether the board has the power to amend
the bylaws, the shareholders typically have the ability to modify or rescind the board’s
amendments.
Since charter amendments cannot be changed, once adopted, without the approval of
the board of directors, it is reasonable to expect that the CEOs would prefer charter
amendments to similar bylaw provisions. If this is the case, then one might expect it to be
more difficult to adopt a change in the charter and for the CEOs with the higher perceived
ability to initiate charter amendments over bylaw provisions. To examine this hypothesis, I
analyze, but do not report, the differences in the adjusted HPRs surrounding the adoption
of five common types of bylaw and charter changes. The results fail to support the
hypothesis that firms adopting charter amendments perform better than those adopting
similar kinds of bylaw provisions.

6. Multivariate analysis of governance changes
The previous tests of CEO characteristics and firm performance are only univariate
in nature. It is possible that potentially interesting results may be obscured by the
failure to control for other factors. In this section, I examine the adoption of poison
pills and charter amendments using a multivariate logistic regressions. The results of
these regressions are reported in Table 9.23 Panel A of Table 9 provides the results of
the logistic regressions on a sample of firms adopting poison pills (dependent
variable=1) compared to firms without any poison pills or other takeover defenses
(dependent variable=0). The regressions suggest that poison pill adoption is negatively
related with CEO tenure, prior performance, and inside ownership, while adoption is
positively related to the number of hostile takeover attempts the previous year and the

22
The states not permitting the board to amend the bylaws without a prior provision in the charter or bylaws
so permitting are Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. The
state of Ohio forbids the practice without allowing firms to ‘‘opt in’’.
23
Several other variables of interest were used in alternative models beyond that reported in Table 9. The
percentage of insiders on the board as well as various measures of CEO compensation were included in
alternative models. In none of the logistic regressions were these variables significant and their inclusion or
omission did not fundamentally alter the results reported in Table 9.

This table provides results of various logistic regressions on firms adopting various governance changes.
Panel A provides the results of the logistic regressions on a sample of firms adopting poison pills
(dependent variable=1) compared to firms without any poison pills or other takeover defenses (dependent
variable=0). Panel B provides the results of the logistic regressions on a sample of firms adopting antitakeover charter amendments (dependent variable=1) compared to firms without any poison pills or other
takeover defenses (dependent variable=0). Panel C provides a direct comparison between samples of firms
adopting poison pills (dependent variable=1) and firms adopting anti-takeover charter amendments
(dependent variable=0). The number of hostile takeover attempts was identified using the SDC Mergers
and Acquisitions Database. Ownership data is from Spectrum as provided on the Compact Disclosure
CDs and is only available for years after 1986. p Values are given in parentheses below the parameter
estimates.

institutional ownership. The CEO tenure result is inconsistent with a story of the CEO
bargaining with the board of directors for governance changes.24 The significant
negative coefficient on prior performance supports the previous univariate results
showing that firms that adopt poison pills tend to under perform prior to adoption.

24

Since firm performance and CEO tenure are correlated and since firms that perform poorly relative to
others frequently get new management or are the victims of the market for corporate control, it is possible that
prior performance proxies for the CEO tenure and turnover.

224

J. Nelson / Journal of Corporate Finance 11 (2005) 197–228

It is also clear from these results that many of these adoptions are in response to an
active hostile market for corporate control.25
Panel B of Table 9 provides the results of the logistic regressions on a
sample of firms adopting anti-takeover charter amendments (dependent variable=1)
compared to firms without any poison pills or other takeover defenses (dependent
variable=0). The regressions suggest that anti-takeover charter amendment adoption
is not related with CEO tenure or prior performance. Adoptions are positively
related to the number of hostile takeover attempts the previous year and
negatively related to both inside and institutional ownership. An interesting result
is the change in sign on the institutional ownership variable between the poison
pill and charter amendment regressions. These results suggest that it may be
more difficult to enact governance changes requiring a shareholder vote when
there is a higher level of institutional ownership. It is also clear from these
results that many of these adoptions are in response to an active hostile market
for corporate control.
Panel C of Table 9 provides a direct comparison between samples of firms
adopting poison pills (dependent variable=1) and firms adopting anti-takeover charter
amendments (dependent variable=0). The results confirm that both prior performance
and institutional ownership are important factors in determining the choice between
poison pills and charter amendments. These results suggest that it may be more
difficult to enact governance changes requiring a shareholder vote when there is a
higher level of institutional ownership. It is also clear from these results that poison
pill adoptions are more likely in response to an active hostile market for corporate
control.

7. Summary and conclusions
I define corporate governance as a set of constraints on managers and shareholders as they bargain to determine how the value of the firm is to be allocated,
providing a framework to understand how governance practices differ across firms
and evolve over time. I find that virtually all sample firms in 1995 were covered
by a least one governance provision or statute that potentially could constrain
shareholder wealth. Where in 1980, it was the exception for a firm to utilize any
of the various governance provisions, by 1995 such provisions were the norm. For
example, over 97% of the firms were covered by one or more provisions that
offered the boards of directors substantial power to reject hostile acquisition
attempts. Furthermore, over 76% of the sample firms had adopted charter amendments limiting shareholder rights, and over 53% of the firms had a poison pill in
place by 1995.
Several interesting stylized facts about corporate governance practices are
gleaned from a cross-sectional examination of governance provisions. First, I
document a high degree of potential redundancy with most firms being covered
25

225

by multiple governance provisions that are potentially harmful to shareholders.
Charter amendments and state anti-takeover statutes that are almost identical in
effect redundantly cover many firms. Second, it is apparent that many firms tend
to adopt multiple charter amendments simultaneously. In fact, of firms amending
their charters, 43% adopt two or more and 23% adopt three or more charter
amendments simultaneously. Third, there is a significant positive correlation
between the adoption of new governance provisions and the external market for
corporate control as proxied for by the number of domestic hostile bids. Fourth,
the prevalence of classified boards of directors has greatly increased over the
sample period from less than 10% of firms in 1980 to almost 60% in 1995. The
classification in boards of directors appears to occur in tandem with the
implementation of anti-takeover provisions that require board approval to be
effective. Finally, I document that very few firms adopting poison pills simultaneously amend their charters. Conditional on a firm making a governance change,
I find a significant negative correlation between the decision to adopt a poison pill
and the decision to amend the charter.
I document that typical firms adopting governance provisions requiring shareholder approval outperform benchmark portfolios for 1, 2, 3 and 5 years prior
to adoption. I also document that typical firms adopting poison pills underperform benchmark portfolios for 1, 2, 3 and 5 years prior to adoption. This
result is confirmed in multivariate logistic regressions that control for other
factors. I find no relationship between CEO age, tenure or compensation
surrounding governance changes. I do find that levels of institutional ownership,
levels of insider ownership and the number hostile bids are, along with prior
performance, important variables in determining both whether a firm will make
changes to its governance structure and the type(s) of changes that are made.
Shareholders appear to be primarily concerned with performance, and are more
likely to vote to increase the power of the boards of directors of better
performing firms, while the boards of poorly performing firms are much more
likely to initiate governance changes, such as poison pills, that circumvent
shareholder approval.

Greenmail is a term used to describe the practice of a corporation buying back a large
number of its own shares through a private transaction at an above market price from a
potential acquirer. In exchange, the acquirer agrees to cease any efforts to gain control of
the firm. Antigreenmail provisions forbid such transactions unless the offer is universal to
all shareholders or the shareholders approve of the transaction. Antigreenmail provisions
can results from a change to a firm’s charter or bylaws, or from a state law.
Is a term used to describe preferred stock, which, when authorized, can have a broad
range of conversion, dividend, voting and other rights as determined by the Board of
Directors. Over 85% of sample firms in 1995 allowed for the use of ‘‘blank check’’
preferred stock. This feature is important since it gives boards of directors the ability to
implement poison pills or to place shares in friendly hands during a takeover attempt.
Corporations argue that ‘‘blank check’’ preferred stock is necessary to provide the board
with flexibility in acquiring financing for the firm. The ability to issue black check
preferred stock must be spelled out in the firm’s charter.
A ‘‘cash out’’ statute provides shareholders the right to ‘‘cash out’’ at the highest acquiring
price at the acquirer’s expense once the acquirer has obtained a threshold percentage of
outstanding shares. This law may force the acquiring firm to purchase additional shares
even after control has been obtained.
A classified board is one where the election of the Board of Directors is staggered over
several overlapping ‘‘classes’’ (typically three). Essentially, having a classified board
makes it more difficult for a successful bidder to gain effective control over the board and
hence the firm. The requirement for a classified board can originate in the firm’s charter or
bylaws, or through state law.
A confidential process for proxy voting is designed to eliminate pressure and potential
conflicts of interest between managers and fiduciaries who vote shares on behalf of other
parties. Under confidential voting, management agrees not to view individual proxy
ballots unless the election is contested.
A control share acquisition statute provides that once an acquirer obtains a designated
percentage of outstanding shares, the majority of the disinterested outstanding shares must
vote to determine whether the acquirer can vote his or her shares. Various state statutes
differ as to conditions of redeeming shares that are denied voting rights. Some states grant
rights to dissenting shareholders.
Cumulative voting allows shareholders to combine their votes for the election of the board
of directors and cast these votes in any manner they desire. Under cumulative voting, the
total number of votes a shareholder is allowed to cast is the number of shares held times
the number of directors up for election. For example, if a firm is electing five new
directors and a shareholder owns 1000 shares, this shareholder, under cumulative voting,
has 5000 votes to cast in any combination for the five directors. Cumulative voting
provides minority shareholders greater ability to elect their favored directors.
These laws allow the board of directors to consider the impact of a merger on stakeholders
other than the shareholders (i.e., employees, suppliers, communities, etc). This provision
allows the board to reject a purchase offer that may be attractive to the shareholders
financially.
These provisions allow for two classes of common stock, each with different voting
rights. Generally, management has effective control over the shares with the preferable
voting rights. Dual class common stock can only be initiated through a provision in the
firm’s charter.

Appendix A (continued)
Fair Price Provision
(FP)

A fair price provision requires that all shareholders receive a ‘‘fair price’’ (typically the
highest price the bidder has paid for any shares acquired) for the shares that they tender.
The fair price provision is used to discourage two tier tender offers. Usually, if the board
of directors, or a supermajority of shareholders, approve of the merger then the bidder will
not be held to the fair price requirement. A fair price provision can result from the firm’s
adoption of a charter or bylaw amendment, or through state law.
Freeze Out Law
Freeze out laws are also known as business combination laws. They typically forbid a
(FO)
business combination between the acquirer and target for three to five years following the
acquisition of a threshold percentage of shares by the acquirer. The effect of the freeze out
law is to discourage acquirers who lack sufficient funds to finance the transaction. The
acquiring firm is essentially barred from gaining accesses to the target firm’s assets.
Golden Parachutes
A golden parachute is a severance package paid to top executives subject to a change in
(GP)
control of the firm.
Limited Ability to
This provision requires a supermajority vote to change the firm’s bylaws. Often, the
Amend Bylaws
voting threshold is greater than the participation level for annual meetings, or the level of
(LAAB)
shares not controllable by management, thereby making the adoption or repealing of
bylaws almost impossible. This provision may be adopted as an amendment to the firm’s
charter or through passage of a bylaw, and is most often adopted after ‘‘anti-takeover’’
bylaws are already in place.
Limited Ability to
This provision requires a supermajority vote to change the firm’s charter. Often the voting
Amend Charter
threshold level is greater than the participation level for annual meetings, or the level of
(LAAC)
shares not controllable by management, thereby making amendments to or repealing
amendments in the charter almost impossible. This provision must be adopted as an
amendment to the firm’s charter, and is most often adopted after ‘‘anti-takeover’’ charter
amendments are already in place.
Limited Ability to
These provisions curtail the shareholders’ ability to call a special meeting. Under these
Call Meeting
provisions, the ability to call a special meeting rests solely with the board of directors or
(LACM)
some officer of the company, or requires the approval of a higher threshold of
shareholders than is required under state law. Such provisions make it more difficult for
shareholders to facilitate a change in control through a special meeting. The ability to call
a special meeting can be determined through charter amendments, bylaws and the law of
the state of incorporation.
Limited Action by
In states that allow action by written consent, this provision limits the shareholders ability
Consent (LAC)
to act without a shareholders meeting. This provision can limit the shareholders ability to
facilitate changes in the board of directors, bylaws or charter without a shareholders
meeting. This feature is particularly powerful if the firm also limits the shareholder’s ability
to call a special meeting. This feature can be adopted through either bylaws or the charter.
Non-Financial Effects These provisions allow the board of directors to consider the impact of a merger on
of Merger (NFEM) stakeholders other than the shareholders (e.g., employees, suppliers, communities, etc.).
This provision allows the board to reject a purchase offer that may be attractive to the
shareholders financially. Some states provide this power to the board of directors through
a director’s duties statute. This provision can be implemented through the adoption of a
charter provision or bylaw.
Poison Pills (PP)
Also called ‘‘shareholder’s rights plans’’, poison bills are designed to force potential
acquirers to negotiate with the firm’s board of directors. If the board views the deal as
favorable, then the board can redeem the pill. Otherwise, once the acquiring firm
accumulates a certain level of stock, the pill is ‘‘triggered’’ granting shareholders the right
to purchase stock in either company as a substantial discount. Unlike, many other antitakeover devices, poison pills can be adopted without a shareholder vote.
Profit Recapture
Profit recapture laws allow companies to recover profits from unsuccessful bidders for
Laws (PR)
shares acquired within 18 to 24 months of the takeover attempt.

Appendix A (continued)
Supermajority to
Approve Merger
(SMM)

Unequal Voting
Rights (UVR)

Supermajority provisions establish a minimum voting threshold above that required by
state law for certain types of transactions including mergers. These provisions can be
adopted through a charter or bylaw provision. Often, the voting threshold level is greater
than the participation level for annual meetings, or the level of shares not controllable by
management, thereby making approval of a merger almost impossible.
With unequal voting rights, the voting power of the shares change based on certain
conditions. Usually, greater voting power is given to shareholders that have owned their
stock for a specified period of time. Another type of provision reduces the voting power
for shares held in large blocks.
