Abstract
We examine whether the agency cost arising from shareholder-bondholder conflict is
an important determinant of the timing of dividend reduction decisions. Firms forced to
reduce dividends owing to bond covenant violations experience lower earnings, more frequent
losses, and greater earnings declines around the dividend reduction year than do firms that
voluntarily reduce dividends. Relative to voluntary-reduction firms, forced-reduction firms
have higher debt-to-equity ratios and managerial holdings. These findings coupled with the
increased dividend payout ratios and lower announcement period returns suggest that financially distressed firms that anticipate poor performance have greater incentives to delay
reducing dividends to avoid a wealth transfer to bondholders.

ity of future financial distress. Ofek (1993) documents that firms in short-term
financial distress react quickly in the distress year by reducing dividends, among
other alternative actions, to ensure that the firms continue as going concerns.’
Alternatively, DeAngelo and DeAngelo (1990) examine long-term financially distressed firms and find that one third of their sample firms do not reduce dividends
despite experiencing losses.’ In addition, a significant fraction of the financially
distressed firms delay reducing dividends until binding bond covenants force them
to do so. In an examination of the dividend policy of a random sample of firms,
Kalay (1980) reports that less than 5% of the firms in his sample are forced to
reduce dividends because of bond covenant violations. The results of these studies
suggest that the duration of financial distress can explain the timing of the dividend
reduction decision. Firms that perform poorly in the short-run voluntarily reduce
dividendswhile those associated with long-term financial distress delay the reduction
decision as long as possible. In this paper, we examine whether the agency cost
arising from the shareholder-bondholder conflict is an important determinant in
explainingwhy some firms voluntarily reduce dividends but others delay the decision
until bond covenants are violated.
The decision to voluntarily reduce dividends can be viewed as a financing
decision: shareholders can use the proceeds of the dividend reduction to finance
value-enhancing projects. Myers (1977) proves that for firms with risky debt, the
gain from increased firm value accrues primarily to bondholders. Similarly, Kalay
(1982) notes that for financially distressed firms, a reduction in dividends benefits
bondholders at the expense of shareholders by increasing the reservoir of available
funds and lowering the risk of debt. Dhillon and Johnson (1994) also find negative
stock returns and positive bond returns on dividend reduction announcements.These
papers suggest that the shareholder-bondholderagency conflict provides an incentive
for managers of financially distressed firms to delay reducing dividends, thus
avoiding wealth transfers from shareholders to bondholders.
The agency cost hypothesis predicts that firms that are performing poorly and
which anticipate continued financial distress will subsequently be forced to reduce
dividends while those that face temporary declines in performance will voluntarily
reduce dividends. The hypothesis also predicts that the managers of forced-reduction
firms will attempt to pay out to shareholders as much of firm value as possible.
This is especially true when managers own a significant fraction of the firm’s equity.
Finally, since the wealth transfer problem is positively related to the firm’s debt
level, the agency cost hypothesis predicts that these implications will be more
pronounced for highly levered firms.

’

Ofek (1993) defines short-term financial distress as one year of above average stock performance
followed by a year of poor performance (in the bottom decile of the market).
DeAngelo and DeAngelo (1990) define financial distress as firms with at least three years of losses.

We find evidence supporting the agency cost hypothesis. Firms that are forced
to reduce dividends due to binding bond covenants (henceforth referred to as forcedreduction firms) experience a significantly lower earnings level and a higher frequency of losses than do firms that voluntarily reduce dividends (voluntarily-reduction firms) for at least three years prior and subsequent to the dividend reduction
announcement year. Despite the poor past and anticipated future operating performance, forced-reductionfirms delay reducing dividends until a year after experiencing
the first loss while voluntary-reductionfirms cut dividends in the year of their first
loss. We also find that by increasing dividends in the years immediately preceding
the dividend reduction decision, forced-reduction firms attempt to pay out as much
of the firm’s value as possible to shareholders. Further, we find that relative to
voluntary-reduction firms, forced-reduction firms have higher debt-to-equity ratios
and larger levels of insider holdings in the pre-announcement period thus providing
a stronger motivation for these firms to delay reducing dividends. The forcedreduction firms also experience significantly more negative stock returns at the
dividend reduction announcement than do voluntary-reduction firms. These results
are robust to alternative explanations.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the sample selection
criteria and the classification scheme used to distinguish between forced- and voluntary-reduction firms. Section 3 reports and analyzes the results. In Section 4 we
summarize and conclude.

2. Sample selection
In this section we describe the sample of firms that reduce dividends, the
criteria used to classify the dividend reduction decision as being either forced or
voluntary, and the firm specific characteristics for both subsamples of firms.

2.I . Dividend reduction sample
A dividend reduction occurs when a firm’s regular per-share cash dividend
(adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends) in the current quarter is lower than
that paid in the previous quarter. Our original sample consists of firms in nonregulated industries listed on Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) tapes
that initiated dividend reductions between January 1982-December 1992. Since
CRSP reports dividend information only for positive dividend payments, we use
the following rules to identify dividend omissions (i.e., zero dividend payments).
If the time difference between two consecutive dividend announcement dates or the
firm’s last dividend announcement and the earlier of the firm’s delisting date on
CRSP or May 31, 1993 exceeds five months, we assume that a dividend omission
has occurred. The five-month period allows delayed dividend announcements to be
included in the sample (see Kalay and Lowenstein, 1986). We then cross-reference

4

R. D’Mello, T. Mukherjee, 0. Tawatnuntachai/The Financial Review 36 (2001) 1-22

the announcements with the Wall Street Journal Index and eliminate observations
that are not listed in the Index.
Since the relation between firm’s operating performance and timing of the
dividend reduction is important, we restrict our attention to those firms that do not
reduce dividends for at least a three-year period immediately preceding the reduction
year. The initial sample consists of 550 firms, of which 449 firms are listed on the
Cornpustat data set. We also omit firms that have no relevant accounting information
(3 firms), or change fiscal year-ends in the dividend reduction year (1 firm), or
have no financial statements in the dividend reduction year because they are acquired
or go private (26 firms). Our final sample consists of 4 19 firms that reduce dividends
between 1982-1992.

2.2. Forced versus voluntary samples
We use the same classification criteria as Kalay (1980) and DeAngelo and
DeAngelo (1990) to distinguish between forced and voluntary dividend reductions.
We classify a dividend reduction as forced if either (a) the level of unrestricted
retained earnings, which we define as the funds that firms can use to pay dividends
under the most restrictive direct or indirect debt covenants, at the year-end added
to the current year’s dividend, is less than the dividend paid in the preceding year,3
or (b) annual reports explicitly state that the dividend is being reduced to comply
with binding bond covenants. Our primary data source for the level of unrestricted
retained earnings and dividend payments is Cornpustat, which provided information
for approximately 60% of the observation^.^ For the remaining firms (157 firms),
we explore other sources such as “Long-Term Debt” section of Moody’s Industrial
Manual, annual reports and 10-K filings. From these sources we obtain information
about debt covenant violations and unrestricted retained earnings levels. If we do
not find an explicit statement of bond covenant violations (34 firms), we assume
that the dividend reduction decision is voluntary. For firms that violate bond covenants and for which no unrestricted retained earnings information is available at
the dividend reduction year-end, we assume an unrestricted retained earnings level
of zero. Overall, 323 firms voluntarily reduce dividends, 96 firms are forced to
reduce dividends, and the number of voluntary reductions exceeds forced reductions
in each year of the sample period.
The dividend reduction definition listed above presents a clear dichotomous
classification (i.e., voluntary versus forced) that we use in subsequent univariate
analyses. However, in practice, the difference between forced and voluntary dividend
reductions might not be so precise. A firm that cannot maintain the previous year’s
dividend level (i.e., forced-reduction firm) might reduce dividends more than the
Kalay (1980) defines unrestricted retained earnings as “reservoir”.

This fraction is similar to that reported by DeAngelo and DeAngelo (1990).

amount by which its retained earnings is restricted, thereby maintaining a positive
unrestricted retained earnings level. The dividend reduction decision for this firm
is therefore comprised of both a voluntary component, defined as the level of
unrestricted retained eamings at the dividend reduction year-end, and a forced
component, which is the difference between the level of dividend reduction and the
voluntary component. Therefore, in the multivariate analyses, the dependent variable
is the extent to which the dividend reduction is forced. This variable takes on a
value between and including zero and one, depending on the unrestricted retained
earnings level at the dividend reduction year-end. For firms that reduce dividends
without binding bond covenants, the entire dividend reduction is voluntary (i.e., the
forced component is zero). Firms with binding bond covenants and whose unrestricted retained earnings level is zero in the dividend reduction year-end have a
forced component of one. For forced-reduction firms with a positive unrestricted
retained earnings level, the forced component of the dividend reduction decision
falls between zero and

2.3. Descriptive statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the sample of forced- and voluntaryreduction firms at the fiscal year-end prior to the dividend reduction announcement.6
The average voluntary-reduction firm is significantly larger in size (assets, and book
and market equity values) and has higher debt and sales levels than is the average
forced-reduction firm. Although there is no statistical difference between the mean
and median market-to-book ratio of common equity between the two subsamples
of firms, the voluntary-reduction firms have significantly higher mean and median
earnings per share and unrestricted retained earnings levels than do the forcedreduction f m s . For the sample of forced-reduction firms, we do not find any
significant differences in financial characteristics (except mean market-to-bookratio)
between the subsamples of firms that had a forced component of one and those that
had a forced component less than one.

3. Results
In this section we report the results from our empirical analysis that examines
the agency cost hypothesis as an explanation for the timing of the dividend reduction
decision. First, we compare the level and change in operating performance of forcedand voluntary-reduction firms. Second, we examine the motivation for delaying
reducing dividends by analyzing leverage ratios and managerial holdings around
There are 11 forced-reductionf m s with a positive voluntary component. Elimination of these fims
in subsequent analyses does not affect the results.
The characteristics of the subsample of f m s for which unrestricted retained earnings information is
available are similar to those of the overall sample.

the dividend reduction year. Finally, we examine the extent to which the timing of
the dividend reduction can be explained by hypotheses other than agency costs.

3.1. Comparison of operating per$onnance
3.1.1. Level of earnings
The agency cost hypothesis predicts that shareholders of poorly performing
firms with expected future losses would not voluntarily reduce dividends to prevent
a wealth transfer to bondholders. Handjinicolaou and Kalay (1984)and Myers (1977)
argue that the seventy of the agency problem is negatively related to the option
value of the firm's equity. Since the value of the equity option falls as the firm's
operating performance declines (i.e., the underlying asset value), the hypothesis
predicts that, ceteris paribus, firms with poor operating performance are more likely
to delay reducing dividends.
We test the prediction of the agency cost hypothesis by examining the firm's
operating performance, which we define as net income before extraordinary losses

R. D’Mello, T. Mukherjee, 0. Tawatnuntachai/The Financial Review 36 (2001) 1-22

available for common shareholders (Cornpustat # 237) standardized by year -3 book
value of assets. We exclude extraordinary items because they do not capture the
firm’s normal operating performance. We standardize earnings by year -3 book
value of assets to control for the bias caused by poorly performing firms divesting
assets (see Ofek, 1993).
Because the implicit assumption of the agency cost hypothesis is that managers
are perfect agents of equity shareholders, we initially examine the payoffs to the
f m ’ s residual claimants. Panel A of Table 2 presents a time series distribution of
earnings performance for voluntary- and forced-reduction firms for the seven-year
period, beginning three years before and ending three years after the dividend
reduction announcement year (year 0).
The median and mean standardized earnings for the voluntary-reduction firms
in the pre-announcementperiod are positive and statistically significant, but decrease
as year 0 approaches. This result is consistent with the conclusion of DeAngelo and
DeAngelo (1990), that managers of financially distressed firms are reluctant to
reduce dividends when firms report positive net income. In the dividend reduction
announcement year, voluntary-reduction firms report median (mean) standardized
earnings of -0.36% (-2.24%). For forced-reduction firms, the decline in earnings in
the pre-announcement period is similar to that reported for voluntary-reduction
firms, but begins a year prior to the reduction year. These firms report an average
loss of 0.76% in year -1 and a significant (0.01 level) median (mean) loss of 6.41%
(9.77%) in the dividend reduction year.
Subsequent to the dividend reduction announcement year, the voluntary-reduction firms show a significant improvement in performance, but the forced-reduction
firms continue to perform poorly. Although the voluntary-reduction subsample reports significantly positive median earnings (at 0.01 level) for all years after year
0, the forced-reduction subsample’s median earnings are negative in all three years
(significant at 0.01 and 0.10 levels in years 1 and 2, respectively). The difference
in median eamings performance between the two groups is significant for all years.
We further test whether forced dividend reductions result from a large unexpected decline in earnings in year 0, rather than a gradual and expected decline as
predicted by the agency cost hypothesis. Panel A of Table 2 presents changes in
earnings, standardized by year -3 book value of assets, for the seven-year period
centered on the dividend reduction year. Forced-reductionf m s not only experience
a decline in earnings earlier (year -2) than the voluntary-reduction firms (year -I),
but the average decline in earnings for these firms is also significantly greater than
that of voluntary-reductionfirms through the dividend reduction year. These results
suggest that the poor performance for the forced-reduction firms is not completely
unanticipated, but rather a culmination of declining earnings over the prior years.
We test the robustness of the above results by using three alternative earnings
measures: (1) annual net income before extraordinary losses available for common
shareholders standardized by contemporaneous sales, (2) earnings before interest
and taxes and depreciation (EBITDA - Compustut # 13) less interest payments and

8

R. D’Mello, T. Mukherjee, 0. Tawatnuntachai/The Financial Review 36 (2001) 1-22

taxes, standardized by assets in year -3, and (3) EBITDA less interest payments
and taxes standardized by contemporaneous sales. Standardizing annual earnings
by year-end sales controls for the likelihood that poorly performing firms sell off
their unproductive assets and that this variable measures the firms’ annual operating
return. Similarly, we use EBITDA less interest payments and taxes because it is a
more precise measure of shareholders’ operating cash flow and controls for potential
earnings manipulation by managers, both of which are potentially significant especially for financially distressed firms. Consistent with the results presented earlier, we
continue to observe that voluntary-reductionfirms significantly outperform forcedreduction firms over the seven-year period (results not tabulated).
These results indicate that both voluntary- and forced-reduction firms experience a decline in earnings prior to reducing dividends. However, although the poor
performance of the voluntary-reduction firms is temporary, that of the forcedreduction firms is deeper and more persistent. The results for the voluntary-reduction
firms are consistent with Ofek’s (1993) conclusions that firms react quickly to
financial distress. In contrast, the results for the forced-reduction firms support the
agency cost hypothesis that firms with persistently poor past operating performance
and anticipated financial distress only reduce dividends when forced to do so because
of bond covenant violations.

3.1.2. Frequency of losses
We also examine the frequency of losses in the pre- and post-announcement
periods for both subsamples of firms. We note that not all firms have all years of
data reported on Compustut. Hence, we report the percentage of years of losses for
which data is available rather than the number of years of losses. “One” indicates
that the firm has losses for all years for which data is available. The results are
presented in Table 2, Panels B and C .
Approximately 60% of the forced-reduction firms experience at least one loss
in the pre-announcement period and the median firm experiences 0.33 years of
losses. For the voluntary-reduction firms, the fraction of firms experiencing at least
one loss is only 26%. The difference between the two groups is highly significant
at the 0.01 level.
The same results hold for the post-announcement period. Approximately 2.3%
of forced-reductionfirms do not suffer a loss in any of the four year-ends subsequent
to the announcement compared to 27.7% of the voluntary-reduction firms. Similarly,
the percentage of firms that experience losses in all the years is 34% for the forced
group, which is significantlyhigher than the 14% for the voluntary group. In addition,
nearly 11.5% of the forced-reduction firms file for bankruptcy in the four-year
period following the dividend reduction announcement compared to only 2.5% of
the voluntary-reduction firms. The difference between the two subsamples is significant at the 0.01 level.

by the year -3 book value of assets. Standardized change in earnings in year t is the change in net
income in year t relative to year t-1, divided by book value of assets in year -3. The frequency of losses
is the number of years that f i s experience negative net income before extraordinary items relative to
the number of years for which data is available. In Panel A, mean results are reported in the first row

These results are even more significant given the following two points: First,
there is significant attrition in the forced-reduction subsample (20%of the initial
sample), resulting in a survivorship bias. Second, in classifying the sample into
forced and voluntary dividend reduction firms, firms whose voluntary component
of the dividend reduction decision falls between zero and one are classified as
forced-reductionf i i s . Both of these factors bias upwards the operating performance
of the forced subsample and against the implication of the agency cost hypothesis.
However, despite these biases, the results presented in Table 2 strongly support the
agency cost hypothesis.

3.1.3. Timing of dividend reduction decision

reducing dividends relative to voluntary-reduction firms by comparing the timing

of the dividend reduction decision relative to the first loss. Figure 1 shows the
operating performance of the forced- and voluntary-reduction samples conditional
on the firms experiencing at least one loss in the seven-year period centered on the
announcement year. Of the initial sample of 419 firms, 277 voluntary-reduction
firms and all 96 forced-reductionfirms experience a loss over the seven-year period.
Although the median voluntary-reductionfirm reacts quickly and reduces dividends
in the year of the f i s t loss, the median forced-reduction firm does not reduce
dividends until one year after the first loss. This result provides strong direct evidence
that forced-reduction firms delay reducing dividends despite poor past, and anticipated future operatingperformance,and is consistent with the agency cost hypothesis.
To the extent that the 46 voluntary-reduction firms avoid experiencing losses
by reducing dividends, this figure is biased against the agency cost hypothesis. A
detailed analysis of these firms shows that they experience a significant decline in
capital expenditures and earnings in years -1 and 0. Thus, these firms are, to a

certain extent, poorly performing firms, even though they do not incur any losses
and appear to reduce dividends to avoid future financial distress.

3.2. Comparison of debt-to-equity ratio
As discussed earlier, the severity of the agency problem is negatively related
to the option value of the firm’s equity. Handjinicolaou and Kalay (1984) and
Dhillon and Johnson (1994) contend that an increase in the firm’s debt level (i.e.,
the option strike price) lowers the option value of the firm’s equity and increases
the agency cost problem. Therefore, the agency cost hypothesis predicts that, ceteris
paribus, firms with high leverage will not reduce dividends until bond covenants
are violated.
We measure leverage by the debt-to-equity ratio, which we define as total debt
divided by market equity capitalization for the same year.7 Table 3 reports the debtto-equity ratio of both subsamples of firms for the seven-year period centered on
the dividend reduction announcement year. Forced-reduction firms have a higher
fraction of debt than do voluntary-reduction firms, especially in the pre-announcement period. The debt-to-equity ratio of both subsamples of firms increases as the
dividend reduction announcement year approaches. The median (mean) debt-toequity ratio of the forced-reduction firms is 1.77 (2.39) and 2.08 (2.98), and that
of the voluntary-reduction firms is 1.01 (1.30) and 1.17 (1.57) in years -1 and 0,
respectively. The test statistics for the difference in mean and median debt-to-equity
ratios between the two subgroups are highly significant for both years at the 0.01
level. Subsequent to the dividend reduction announcement year, forced-reduction
firms continue to experience significantly higher debt-to-equityratios than do voluntary firms. These findings are consistent with the implication of the agency cost
hypothesis that highly leveraged firms (forced-reduction firms) despite poor operating performance delay reducing dividends relative to low leveraged firms (voluntary-reduction firms).

3.3. Comparison of dividend payout policy
As we have noted, the agency cost hypothesis also predicts that prior to reducing
dividends, managers of financially distressed firms will attempt to exploit bondholders by transferring as much wealth to equity shareholders as possible. We test this
implication by examining the dividend policies of forced- and voluntary-reduction
firms in the three-year pre-announcement period. We define normalized dividend

’

We obtain similar results if we use only long-term debt as the numerator in the calculation of the debtto-equity ratio. We also test the robustness of our results by defining both debt and equity in terms of
book value. Since poorly performing forced-reduction firms experience a decline in equity value prior
to the dividend reduction announcement, using market equity value as the denominator increases the
leverage ratio for these firms and biases the results in favor of the agency cost hypothesis. We obtain
similar results.

for year t as dividend at year t divided by year -1 dividend, adjusted for stock splits
and stock dividends. By construction, the normalized dividend in year -1 is one and
for any prior year a ratio less than one implies that the firm has increased dividends.
Change in dividend in year t is relative to year t-1 and is standardized by year -1
dividend.
Table 4 presents the results for the forced- and voluntary-reduction groups.
Both subsamples of firms have mean (median) dividend ratios of less than one for
all years prior to year -1 except in year -2. This finding suggests that firms increase
dividends prior to year 0.8The test statistics for the difference in mean and median
levels and changes in dividends between the two groups of firms are statistically
insignificant. In addition to raising dividends, 10.7% of the sample firms initiate
dividends. Although dividend increases by poorly performing firms is surprising,
such a decision by forced-reduction firms is even more puzzling, especially when
the funds available for dividend payments (unrestricted retained earnings) for these
firms are significantly lower than those for the voluntary-reductionfirms in the preannouncement period. However, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that

managers attempt to exploit bondholdersby manipulating dividend policy and paying
out as much of firm value as possible.

3.4. Level of insider holdings
The evidence presented so far is consistent with the agency cost hypothesis.
First, firms with poor operating performance and expected financial distress delay
reducing dividends. Second, the delay is more pronounced for highly levered firms.
Third, the managers attempt to payout as much of firm value as possible. As stated
earlier, a fundamental assumption of this hypothesis is that managers work in the
best interest of current shareholders,i.e., managers engage in these types of activities
since they are major stakeholders in the firm. To test this, in Table 5 we compare
levels and changes in insider holdings for both the forced- and voluntary-reduction
groups.

We obtain information about insider holdings for three years prior to the
dividend reduction announcement year from proxy statements filed with the SEC.9
We find that insiders of the median forced-reduction firm hold approximately 17%
of the firm's outstanding shares in year -1. However, those of the voluntary-reduction
firm hold only 11% of the firm's equity. The difference in median (mean) insider
holdings between the two groups is significant at 0.05 (0.10) level. We find similar
results for years -2 and -3.
We also test whether insiders of the forced-reductionfirms, anticipating financial distress, reduce their holdings more dramatically than do insiders of voluntaryreduction firms. In year -2 we find that the mean and median decline in insider
holdings of the forced-reduction firms are significantly higher than that for the
voluntary-reduction firms." Both results are consistent with the prediction of the
agency cost theory.
Insider holding data is relatively infrequent. We find information for only 263 fms.
lo We eliminate observations where the change in insider holding exceeds 200%. When we examine the
full sample, we find that the average percentage decline in insider holding from year -1 to year -3 is
significantly higher for forced-reduction f m s relative to voluntary-reduction firms.

3.5. Multivariate regression analyses
In this section, we present regression results of the association between the
decision to reduce dividends and the firm’s operating performance, average debtto-equity ratio, and level of insider holdings. The dependent variable is the degree
to which the dividend reduction is forced. Its value ranges from one (if the firm
has no unrestricted retained earnings at the year-end) to zero (if the bond covenants
are not binding). We find similar results when we estimate logit regressions in
which the dependent variable is the dichotomous classification used in our earlier
univariate analyses.”
We use two measures as proxies for the firm’s operating performance, the
fraction of years of losses for the three years prior to the dividend reduction year
and the level of standardized earnings for the three years prior to the dividend
reduction announcement year. We also use the fraction of years of losses subsequent
to the dividend reduction announcement as a proxy for expected future performance.12 We use the average three-year pre-announcement debt-to-market equitycapitalization ratio to measure the f i ’ s debt exposure. To test the manager’s
motivation to delay reducing dividends, we also include the log of the average
insider holdings over the three-year pre-announcement period. The agency cost
hypothesis predicts a negative coefficient for earnings level and positive coefficients
for fraction of years of losses both prior and subsequent to the reduction, average
debt-to-equity ratio, and insider holdings.
The results in Table 6 indicate that the degree to which the dividend reduction
is forced depends significantlyon past earnings performance. The coefficients for the
standardized earnings level for years -3, and -1 (regressions 1and 5) are significantly
negative, and those for the fraction of years of losses in the pre-announcement
period (regression 2, 6, and 8) are significantly positive. We obtain similar results
when we use standardized earnings changes as a proxy for operating performance.
These findings confirm the results of earlier univariate analyses. We also find that
the coefficients for future expected profits and debt-to-equity level are positive and
significant (regressions 3, 4, 5 , and 6). This suggests that both future performance
and leverage ratios are important determinants in explaining the timing of the
dividend reduction decision. Finally, the coefficients for insider holdings level are
also significantly positive, as we expected. The regression results are consistent
with the univariate results presented earlier and the implications of the agency cost
hypothesis.

unknown at the time of the dividend reduction, “future earnings realization are a reasonable empirical
proxy for managers’ expectations of future earnings.”

Regression analysis for forced versus voluntary dividend reductions between 1982-1992
The dependent variable i s the fraction of the dividend reduction that is forced. Its value ranges from 0 to 1. The independent variables are the fraction of years
of losses in the three years preceding the dividend reduction year, the standardized net income before extraordinary items for three years prior to the dividend
reduction announcement year, the average debt-to-equity ratio in the three years prior to the dividend reduction year, the fraction of years of losses in the four
year-ends subsequent to the dividend reduction announcement, and the log of average insider holdings in the three-year period prior to the dividend reduction
announcement year.

3.6. Abnormal stock price reaction
The agency cost hypothesis predicts that the announcementperiod stock returns
will be higher (i.e., less negative) for voluntary-reduction firms than for forcedreduction firms. To examine this implication, we define abnormal stock returns as
returns in excess of the value-weighted market index. We obtain the announcement
day (day 0) from CRSP for dividend cuts and The Wall Street Journal Index for
dividend omissions. We define the announcement period as the three-day window
centered on day 0. The results are similar when we use a five-day announcement
period window or a subsample of firms that is uncontaminated by other events
during the announcement period window.
Table 7 presents the results. For the voluntary-reduction firms, the mean (median) announcement period return is -4.32% (-3.52%) and is significantly higher
than the -8.35% (-7.58%)for the forced-reduction firms. The mean three-day abnormal return for the uncontaminated subsamples of the voluntary- and forced-reduction
firms is -4.33 and -8.66%, respectively. The differences in abnormal returns are
significant at the 0.01 level.
We find that approximately 67% (32%) of forced- (voluntary-) dividend reductions are omissions. Since prior studies find a more negative stock price reaction
for dividend omissions than for dividend cuts, the greater negative stock price
reaction of forced reductions could be explained by the higher fraction of dividend
omissions in the ~amp1e.l~
We test this hypothesis by dividing the full sample into firms that cut dividends
and those that omitted dividends, and then compare the announcement-period returns
between the forced- and the voluntary-reduction subsamples. For the voluntaryreduction firms (219 observations), the median abnormal announcement dividend
cut return is -3.48%. Although it is less negative, it is not significantly different
from the -4.21% for the median forced-reduction firm (32 observation^).'^ For the
uncontaminated subsamples,the mean and median differencebetween the two groups
exceeds 1%, but it is statistically insignificant. For dividend omissions, the median
abnormal return for voluntary-reduction firms is significantly less negative than that
of the forced-reduction firms.
Overall, these results suggest that the market anticipates continued poor operating performance for forced-reduction firms and thus reacts more negatively
to their announcements of dividend reductions than to similar announcements by
voluntary-reduction firms.
l 3 Christie (1994) reports risk-adjusted abnormal returns of -7.04% and -7.33% for dividend omissions
and cuts, respectively. Also see Healy and Palepu (1988).

The small sample size for the forced-reduction f i i s might explain the insignificant test results.

3.7. Testing alternative explanations
In this section, we test some alternative hypotheses to agency costs as an
explanation for the difference in the timing of the dividend reduction decision. We
examine whether firms voluntarily reduce dividends as a source of financing for
subsequent investment activities, rather than as a corrective action to current poor
performance. We use two variables as proxies for investment activities: capital
expenditure to total assets, and selling, general, and administrative expenses to sales.
We examine long-run changes from year +3 to year -1 and annual changes averaged
over the three years subsequent to the dividend reduction announcement year.
Finally, we also study the change in ratios from one- (three-) year(s) subsequent to
one year preceding the announcement.
An analysis of the full sample of voluntary-reductionfirms shows no improvement in average annual and long-run changes in post-announcement investment
activities relative to year -1 (not reported). This confirms that the decision to reduce
dividends by these firms is not motivated by future financing needs, but rather by
preserving firm value.
We also test whether the difference in timing between the two groups can be
explained by differences in industry composition. We classify firms into industry
groups based on the first-digit SIC code. We do not find any significant difference in
the fraction of firms in different industries between forced- and voluntary-reduction
subsamples. Further, we examine whether voluntary-reduction firms reduce dividends early relative to their first loss because they are more closely monitored by

20 R. D’Mello, T.Mukherjee, 0. Tawatnuntachai/The Financial Review 36 (2001) 1-22
bondholders, compared to forced-reduction firms. Bondholders are more likely to
lend money to a firm if managers reduce dividends. This hypothesis therefore
predicts a higher increase in total debt financing for voluntary-reduction firms
relative to forced-reduction firms prior to the dividend reduction announcement.
The results in Panel A of Table 8 provide evidence to the contrary. We find that
the increase in debt level of forced-reduction firms is significantly higher than that
for the voluntary-reduction firms in years -3 and -1.
Finally, we test the possibility that the timing of the dividend reduction decision
is influenced by the growth opportunities facing the firm, rather than by the agency
cost hypothesis. Firms with valuable future opportunities have an incentive to react
quickly to poor performance and voluntarily reduce dividends because of the high
cost associated with losses of future growth opportunities (the cost of financial
distress hypothesis). Alternatively, firms with few growth opportunities will delay
reducing dividends because of the low marginal cost of delaying dividend reduction.
Therefore, this hypothesis predicts that voluntarily-reductionfirms have higher levels
of investment opportunities than do forced-reduction firms.
We use two proxies for future growth opportunities; the ratio of intangible
assets (Cornpustat # 33) to total assets (Cornpusfat # 6) and the ratio of research
and developmental expenditures (R&D - Cornpustat # 46) to sales (Cornpustat #
12).15We control for the poor performance immediately preceding the dividend
reduction year by examining these proxies for the three-year period ending in year 2 relative to the dividend reduction announcement year. The results are also reported
in Table 8.
We find that the forced-reduction firms have significantly higher levels of R&
D to their sales ratios relative to the voluntary-reduction firms for all three years
(Panel B). This finding is inconsistent with the implications of the cost of financial
distress hypothesis. In addition, we do not find any significant differences in mean
and median intangible to total assets ratios between the forced- and voluntaryreduction firms. These results suggest that despite having more valuable investment
opportunities in the pre-announcement period, forced-reduction firms postpone the
reduction decisions until bond covenants are violated.

4. Summary and conclusion
This paper examines whether the agency cost arising from shareholder-bondholder conflict explains the timing of the dividend reduction decision. Dividend
reduction in the face of continued poor performance transfers wealth from shareholders to bondholders. Thus, the agency cost hypothesis posits that firms that experience
persistent poor performance and anticipate financial distress or bankruptcy will
delay voluntarily reducing dividends until bond covenants force them to do so to
prevent a wealth transfer from shareholders to bondholders.

The results for firms that are forced to reduce dividends support the agency
cost hypothesis. These firms perform poorly prior to the dividend reduction announcement year and report significantly lower levels of income than do the voluntary-reduction firms for the three-year period including the dividend reduction announcement year. Further, the forced-reduction firms experience greater numbers
of annual losses than do the voluntary-reduction firms. Despite poor operating
performance and lower levels of unrestricted retained earnings, the forced-reduction
firms do not reduce dividends until a year subsequent to the first loss. Instead, a
significant fraction of these firms increase dividends in the pre-announcement period.
Poor performance for the forced-reduction firms also persists beyond the time
that the firms reduce dividends. These firms continue to report losses for at least

22 R. D’Mello, T. Mukherjee, 0. Tawatnuntachai/The Financial Review 36 (2001) 1-22
three years subsequent to the dividend reduction year, but the voluntary-reduction
firms report significantpositive earnings. Further, a significant fraction of the forcedreduction firms file for bankruptcy. The forced-reduction firms also have significantly higher debt-to-equity ratios and managerial ownership compared to the voluntary-reduction firms providing greater incentives to delay reducing dividends. The
announcement period return results are consistent with these findings: The market
reacts more negatively to forced reductions than to voluntary reductions.
Overall, these results are consistent with the shareholder-bondholderconflict
hypothesis of Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Myers (1977): Firms that expect
prolonged financial distress continue to maintain or even increase dividend payments
until forced by bond covenants to reduce payouts, thus avoiding a transfer of wealth
to bondholders.
