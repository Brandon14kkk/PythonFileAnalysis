Abstract
Implied standard deviation is widely believed to be the best available forecast of the
volatility of returns over the remaining contract life (Jorion, 1995). In this paper,
we take this result two steps further to the higher moments of the distribution
(skewness and kurtosis) based on a Gram ± Charlier series expansion of the normal
distribution (Corrado and Su, 1996) using long-term CAC 40 option prices
contract, named PXL. First, we found that implied first moments contain a
substantial amount of information for future moments of CAC 40 returns although
this amount decreases with respect to the moment's order. Secondly, we found that
the different shapes of the volatility smile are consistent with different distribution of
the underlying returns. Based on these results, we also observed that including other
implied moments significantly improves the out-of-sample pricing performance of
the Black ±Scholes, (1973) model.
Keywords: implied density function; smile; volatility; skewness; kurtosis.

1. Introduction
Volatility has already been the subject of extensive studies, including, the work on the
implied volatility in option prices (Beckers, 1981; Day and Lewis 1992; Canina and
Figlewski, 1993; Jorion, 1995; Bates, 1996a). Concerning the third and fourth

moments (skewness and kurtosis respectively) only a few recent studies have been
made (see Jackwerth and Rubinstein, 1996; Corrado and Su, 1996; Campa, Chang
and Reider, 1997, for example). In this paper, we investigate how implied volatility,
skewness and kurtosis together change magnitude over time. We then test the
informational content of these three implied moments.
The skewness and kurtosis in expected index returns have been recently documented
for the American stock market by Jackwerth and Rubinstein (1996) and Corrado and
Su (1996) using S&P 500 options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. For
this index, negative skewness and excess of kurtosis were observed in the probability
density function. Since first documented in the 1987 stock market crash they reflect
either a higher probability attached to a future crash, or a higher valuation of returns
in the event of a crash.
Only a few studies have been done in a European stock market; thus, the empirical
research in this paper has been done using a database that contains reported trades
and quotes covering call and put long-term CAC 40 option prices contract, named
PXL, traded on the MONEP (MarcheÂ des Options NeÂgociables de Paris). This market
(which opened in September 1987) has been quoting prices for an increasing number
of contracts and offering investors a deeper degree of liquidity. The daily study period
extends from 1 January 1995 through 31 May 1997.
First, we tested the informational content of implied moments on future moments
of CAC 40 returns. While Jorion pointed out that measures of volatility implied in
option prices were the best available volatility forecasts, these results in fact appear to
be in sharp contrast to those of Canina and Figlewski (1993). Following their
methodology we tested if the implied volatility, skewness and kurtosis together
contain substantial information for future moments of CAC 40 returns over the
remaining contract life.
Second, we studied the informational content of implied distribution on future
implied moments of CAC 40 returns. In addition to the obvious reasons, a common
motivation for implied parameters is the abundant empirical evidence that the
benchmark Black and Scholes (1973) formula exhibits strong pricing biases across
moneyness (i.e. the smile) and that it especially underprices out-of-the-money puts and
calls (see Bates, 1996). Such evidence is clearly indicative of implicit stock return
distributions that are negatively skewed with higher kurtosis than allowable in a Black
and Scholes (1973) distribution. Guided by this evidence, the search for alternative
models has focused mostly on finding the right distributional assumption. We find, for
instance, that different shapes of the volatility smile are consistent with different
distributions of the underlying returns. We also test if including other moments
significantly improve the out-of-sample pricing performance of the Black and Scholes
(1973) model.
Concerning methodologies to extract the entire risk neutral probability density
function, Campa et al. (1997) pointed out: `despite their methodological differences, the
approaches lead to a similar probability density function clearly distinct from the
lognormal benchmark, and typically characterized by skewness and kurtosis'. Moreover,
in a more general setting Jondeau and Rockinger (1998) noticed some homogeneity of
the implied risk neutral density derived by different approaches. Following these results,
we concentrate, in this paper, on a semi-parametric methodology derived by Corrado
and Su (1996) analogous to that of Jarrow and Rudd (1982).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 reviews the methodology of
Corrado and Su (1996) on recovering the implied probability density function by a

Gram-Charlier series expansion. Section 3 is devoted to the selection of PXL option
prices data and takes into account some of the French market particularities, like
dividend payment and settlement procedures. Section 4 investigates the informational
content of implied moments on future moments of CAC 40 returns. Section 5 analyses
the relationship between some of the first moments of the distribution and the
volatility `smile' and studies the out-of-sample pricing performance of the Black and
Scholes (1973) model and the Gram ±Charlier series expansion.
2. Gram ± Charlier series expansion framework
Placing the emphasis on structure of the terminal distribution rather than using a
stochastic process implies costs and benefits. With regard to costs, the recovered
distribution is independent of the evolution of the asset price prior to expiration.
This means that the technique will provide no guidance for constructing dynamic
hedges or replicating strategies for the option. In addition, the technique does not
allow the time series properties of the underlying asset to be used in ex post
evaluation of the model. The benefits of this technique arise from its flexibility,
generality, and directness. A reasonably flexible functional form for the terminal
distribution, such as the one used here, can easily accommodate a wide variety of
shapes for terminal distribution. Working with equally flexible processes can be
quite difficult. More importantly, starting with the terminal distribution is a more
general approach since a given terminal distribution encompasses many stochastic
processes, where a given process is consistent with only one terminal distribution.
This technique allows the option data to directly infer some information concerning
the shape of the distribution rather than forcing it to pass through the potentially
distortionary filter of a misspecified process. By using exchange option prices to
extract the entire risk neutral probability density function Campa et al. (1997)
compare three alternative smoothing methods Ð cubic splines, an implied binomial
tree and a mixture of lognormals Ð for transforming option data into the probability
density function. As they point out: `despite their methodological differences, the
three approaches lead to a similar probability density function clearly distinct from
the lognormal benchmark, and typically characterized by skewness and kurtosis'.
Further, Jondeau and Rockinger (1998) obtain approximately the same results using
different approaches involving non-parametric (Breeden and Litzenberger, 1978),
semi-parametric (Madan and Milne (1994) using Hermite Polynomials, Jarrow and
Rudd (1982) using Edgeworth expansion), parametric ones like Jump Poisson
processes (Bates, 1996) and stochastic volatility (Heston, 1993). More precisely they
noticed some homogeneity of the implied risk neutral density derived by these
techniques. Based on these results in this paper we concentrate on a semi-parametric
methodology, analogous to that of Jarrow and Rudd (1982) derived by Corrado and
Su (1996). The main difference is that they used a Gram ± Charlier series expansion
of the normal probability density function instead of an Edgeworth expansion of the
lognormal probability density function.
As recalled by Corrado and Su (1996) a Gram ±Charlier series expansion of the
density function f (x) can be defined as follows:
f(x) 

Equation (1) expresses the call price as Black-Scholes formula plus two terms
involving the skewness (Sk) and kurtosis (Ku) of the logarithm of the underlying asset
price.
3. Data and methodology
With respect to CAC 40 index options, we must distinguish between short maturity
contracts, PX1 with an American feature and long maturity contracts, PXL designed
like a European option. The former has been quoted since November 1988 and the
latter since October 1991. For PX1 the longest maturity is 6 months, whereas that for
PXL is 2 years with fixed expiration in March and September.
3.1. Data
Based on the following considerations, we use PXL option prices for our empirical
work. First, options written on this index are the most actively traded long-term
European-style contracts. Second, data on the daily dividend distributions are
available for the index (from the MONEP-SBF CD-ROM). The sample period
extends from 1 January 1995 through 31 May 1997. Therefore, the data set includes
option prices for 600 trading days. The daily closing quotes for the PXL call and put
options 2 are obtained from the MONEP-SBF CD-ROM. The recorded CAC 40 index
values are the daily closing index levels.
The interest rate was assumed to be the yield to maturity on a zero coupon bond
maturing as close as possible to the option expiration date. Nevertheless, Rubinstein
(1985) said `Compared to the other variables estimated, small measurement errors in
interest rates should have little effect on computed implied volatility'. Moreover,
Lauterbach and Schultz (1990) pointed out for the pricing of warrants: `... we find
little evidence of a relation between model pricing errors and interest rates'. Interest
rate data used in this paper has been obtained from Datastream. Interest rates for 1, 3,
6 and 12 month Pibor rate and a 2 year rate provided by the Datastream database are
utilized. The 1-month rate is used in the model for options with maturities less than 1
month to expiration. Interest rates for options with maturities between 1 month and 2
years are obtained by interpolating rates of notes with both just longer and shorter
maturities. For example, if an option expires in 4 months, the interest rate used to
price the option is obtained by adding 2=3 times the rate on a 3 month note and 1=3
times the rate on 6 month notes.
The CAC 40 Index is computed from a sample of 40 French stocks traded on the
ReÂglement Mensuel (RM) market. In order to take into account the slightly forward
feature of the CAC 40 index, we need to introduce Ln  1 which represents the
settlement date just after the expiration date, T, and L1 denotes the settlement date
just after the present date, t. Let f(It, K, , r) be the option price at time t, with an
underlying asset price equal to I, an exercise price K, and an expiration date T. We
also define:
ST  IT exp ÿ r LT n  1 (Ln  1 ÿ T )
2

Rubinstein pointed out that, by using call and put option prices, the possible effects of
mismeasurement in the riskless rate can be mitigated (c.f. Fleming, Ostdiek and Whaley (1995)
p. 270).

where IT is the CAC 40 index value at time T, r LT n  1 denotes the annualised implicit
forward interest rate for the period running from the expiration date, T, to the next
settlement date Ln  1. The European call option price at expiration can be rewritten:
max(IT ÿ K, 0)  max(ST exp (r LT n  1 (Ln  1 ÿ T )) ÿ K, 0)
 exp (r LT n  1 (Ln  1 ÿ T ))max(ST ÿ K , 0).
0

With K  K exp ÿ r LT n  1 (Ln  1 ÿ T ), the option price becomes in this case:


0
exp (r LTn  1 (Ln  1 ÿ T )) f St ; K ; ; r Tt
0

The actual value of S is given by:
St  It exp ÿr LT 1 (Ln ÿ t )
where r Lt 1 denotes the annualized implicit forward interest rate for the period running
from the present date, t, to the next settlement date L1. Finally, we obtain:
exp (r LTn  1 (Ln  1 ÿ T )) f (It exp (ÿ r Lt 1 (Lt ÿ t)); K ; ; r Ti )
0

where K  K exp ÿ r LT n  1 (Ln  1 ÿ T ). As Ln  1 ÿ T Å 1 month and L1 ÿ t Å 1 month,
we consider that r LT n  1  r Lt 1  r1 where r1 is the one month interest rate. The option
price reduces to:
0

where

Ln  1 ÿ L1


:

For European options, we must take into account the distribution of dividends. For
each option contract with  periods to the expiration date from time t, we first obtain
the present value of the daily dividends D(t), PV(D(t, )), by computing:
PV(D(t; )) 

X
ÿt

e ÿR(t; s)s D(t  s)

s1

where R(t, s) is the s-period yield to maturity. In the next step, we subtract the present
value of future dividends from the time-t index level, in order to obtain the adjusted
dividend for CAC 40 index series that will be used as input into the option models.
This procedure is repeated for all option maturities and for each day in our sample. In
order to take into account the time patterns of the dividend distributions concerning
the 40 stocks of the CAC 40 index, MONEP-SA has decided to consider only eight exdividend dates per year. The dates are 15 January, 15 April, 15 May, 9 and 25 June, 2,
15 and 31 July. Our empirical study takes into account the span of time of these eight
dividend dates per year. Nevertheless, we have replaced the last one by the first of
December, as shown in Figure 1.
Several exclusion filters have been applied to construct the option price data. First,
as options with less than 3 months and more than 9 months to expiration may induce
liquidity related biases, they are excluded from the sample. Therefore, on a given day
we have only one option maturity class because there are only two expiration dates per
year (in March and September of each year). On the first of January and the first of

July of each year we consider the next class of options since we omit any option to
having a maturity date of less than 3 months. Second, to mitigate the impact of price
discreteness on option valuation, price quotes lower than one index point are not
included. Third, to lower the bias associated with non-synchronous trading, option
quotations with daily volume of less than 10 contracts and=or contracts for which the
absolute value of the moneyness exceeds 20% are eliminated from the sample. Finally,
we eliminate from the sample any set of option prices that violate one of Merton's
(1973) distribution-free bounds. In particular, we have eliminated sets that violate the
upper or lower boundary conditions, the convexity relation, or the restriction on the
difference between option prices divided by the difference in their strike prices. These
filters ensure that there are no static arbitrage opportunities in the data set. Moreover,
if the number of option prices available on a given day is less than three; then the
corresponding day is excluded. The resulting data set includes option prices for 585
days during the sample period. In total, 4, 041 daily price observations meet our
inclusion criteria (Table 1). The number of call and put prices available on a given day
ranges from 3 to 13, with a median of 7.

3.2. Methodology
Our first set of estimation procedures leads us to estimate implied volatility on a daily
basis for call and put long-term options on the French CAC 40 index. On a given day
for the given option maturity class between 3 and 9 months, we obtain a unique
implied volatility from all prices using as Whaley (1982) did a simultaneous equations
procedure by minimizing the following sum of squares with respect to the previous
argument:

In equation (2), N is the total number of price quotations available on a given day

having time to expiration , given an estimate for the volatility of the returns on the
index over the time to expiration, I ().
Our second set of estimation procedures estimate implied volatility, skewness, and
kurtosis parameters simultaneously using all prices on a given day for a given maturity
class, by minimizing the following sum of squares with respect to the previous
arguments:

volatility, I (), the skewness, SkI ( ) and the kurtosis, KuI (), of the returns on the
index over the time to expiration.
We analyse the time patterns of implied probability distributions by calculating the
skewness and kurtosis for each day. We can see from Table 2 and Figure 2 that on
average the kurtosis is greater than three. This indicates that the market participants'

anticipation for extreme values is higher than that forecast by the normal distribution.
Further, the negative skewness indicates that the left tail is fatter (higher probability)
and usually extends out further than the right tail; large negative observations are
more likely than large positive ones. With regard to the second moment of the implied
risk neutral distribution, we notice that both implied volatility are close and not as
high.

4. Is implied distribution an accurate forecast of the underlying distribution?
In this section, we investigate the information content and predictive power of
volatility, skewness and kurtosis implied in PXL option prices. In fact, while early
studies (see Jorion, 1995 and Canina and Figlewski, 1993) of the information content
in option prices focus on the volatility, in this paper we have extended this approach
to the skewness and kurtosis. While Jorion (1995) has found that implied volatility
contains substantial information for future volatility, Canina and Figlewski (1993),
however, report that implied volatility has little predicative power for future volatility,
and produces significantly biased forecasts. Define t ( ), Skt ( ), Kut () to be the

For example, the predictive power of a volatility forecast can be estimated by
regressing the observed volatility on forecast volatility: 3

where Ã t is the volatility forecast measured on day t, taken as the implied volatility,
I, t (). In addition Canina and Figlewski (1993) suggest that an AR(1) specification
using the historical rate dominates the OEX implied volatility as a forecast of
observed volatility. The historical volatility rate is defined as t ÿ  (). For the other
two moments the procedure is similar. As pointed out by Jorion (1995) and Canina
and Figlewski (1993), with horizons of up to 9 months, however, using all the day data
introduces overlaps in the error terms, which causes downward bias in the usual
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) standard errors. While White's (1980) covariance
matrix presumes that the residuals to the estimated equation are serially uncorrelated,
Newey and West (1987) have proposed an alternative that gives consistent estimates of
the covariance matrix in the presence of both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.
The predictive power hypothesis is tested and results are presented in Table 3.It
shows that both implied volatilities (Black-Scholes and Gram-Charlier) contain a
substantial amount of information for future volatility. Both slope coefficients are
significantly different from zero. Furthermore, they are not significantly different
from the number one. These results are in sharp contrast with those of Canina and
Figlewski (1993) who report a slope coefficient of implied volatility of 0.229. Besides
we could say that unconstrained implied volatility have higher R 2 than the constrained
ones. As for historical volatility, in Table 3 we can observe that no substantial amount
of information for future volatility is recoverable.
Concerning skewness, Table 3 shows that implied skewness contains a substantial
amount of information for future skewness. The slope coefficient is 0.6791 and the R 2
is 0.2983. The historical skewness forecast produces a lower explanatory power than

We only present the regression equation for the volatility, but a similar methodology is used
for higher moments.

5. The relation between underlying distribution and Black-Scholes implied patterns
In this section we are going to show that different shapes of the volatility smile are
consistent with different distributions of the underlying asset. Renault and Touzi
(1996) proved that, when volatility was stochastic but uncorrelated with changes in the
spot price, Black and Scholes implied volatility was first lowest for at-the-money
forward (strike price equal the forward underlying asset price or x  0), secondly
increasing for both in-the-money (call's strike lower than the forward underlying asset
price or x > 0) and out-of-the-money (call's strike greater than the forward underlying
asset price or x < 0) options. This pattern has been referred to as the `volatility smile',
so named for the appearance of a graph with implied volatility on the vertical axis and
the option strike price on the horizontal axis. If we define the implied volatility I as
the value of volatility that equates the Black-Scholes formula, BS, to the theoretical
price given by the Gram-Charlier series expansions, then:
BS(I )  C

Of these, only the first and last terms seem to have any significant effect. Therefore, an

implied volatility does not converge towards the volatility but towards:

For this maturity, we can observe a departure of the implied probability density
function derived by the Gram-Charlier series expansion from that derived using the
normal law. The implied skewness and kurtosis are different from those expected by
the Black-Scholes model.
For instance, a symmetric volatility smile is consistent with leptokurtosis or `fat
tails' in the distribution, i.e. higher probabilities, as compared with the normal
distribution, of larger positive or negative changes, as would result from returns with
stochastic volatility. At times, the probability of future asset or index return
observations is not symmetrically distributed around the `at-the-money' strike price.
When this asymmetry is present, the smile can be transformed into a `smirk', with
the option's implied volatility rising more sharply for strike prices on one side of the
asset returns than on the other. Less documented in the literature is a convexity
(concavity) in the smile which is due to the kurtosis. In fact when we compute the
Black and Scholes' volatility implied by formula (1). As shown in Figure 3, a
concave `smile' will appear if the kurtosis is less than three, whatever the level of the
skewness is.

This ends up in a platykurtic distribution rather than a leptokurtic one. 4 Besides,
whatever the level of this kurtosis is, a negative skewness leads to a `smirk' rather than
a `smile', but with a slight convexity (concavity) in the case of a kurtosis which is
greater or less than three. We have shown that the in-sample fit of implied volatility is
better as we extend from the Black ±Scholes to skewness and kurtosis. As one may
argue, this better fit might simply be a consequence of having a larger number of
parameters. To lower the impact of this connection on inferences, we turn to
examining each model's out-of-sample pricing performance. For out-of-sample
pricing, the presence of more parameters may actually cause over-fitting which may
penalize the model if the extra parameters do not improve its structural fitting (see for
example Dumas, Fleming and Whaley 1998). For this purpose, we rely on previous
day's option prices to back-out the required parameter values and then use them as
input to compute current day's model-based option prices. Next, we subtract the
model-determined price from its observed counterpart, to compute both Mean
Absolute pricing Error (MAE) and Mean Relative pricing Error (MRE). Two groups

Jackwerth and Rubinstein (1996) found that the implied distributions in the pre-crash period
were somewhat left-skewed and platykurtic. After the crash in the fourth quarter of 1987, they
found a period of adjustment where the distributions became more left-skewed and changed
from platykurtic to leptokurtic (p. 1628± 1629).

of results are presented. Pricing errors reported in Table 4 are split in three categories
(All options, calls and puts), as in Table 5 (OTM, ATM and ITM). 5
It can be noticed that both pricing error measures rank the Gram ± Charlier series
expansion first, and the Black ±Scholes model second. According to both measurements, the Gram ± Charlier series expansion does far better than Black ± Scholes in
pricing OTM calls and puts.
6. Conclusion
This paper has focused on extracting CAC 40 index information from long-term
option prices quoted on the MONEP based on a Gram ± Charlier series expansion
truncated after the fourth moment as derived by Corrado and Su (1996). First we find
an implied distribution with a negative skewness and a higher kurtosis than that
forecast by the normal one. Secondly, we observe that implied moments contain a
substantial amount of information for future moments of CAC 40 returns although
this amount decreases with respect to the moment's order. Third, we find that
different shapes of the volatility smile are consistent with different distributions of the

underlying returns. We also observe that including other implied moments
significantly improve the out-of-sample pricing performance of the Black ± Scholes
(1973) model. These facts reveal that financial management needs to take into
consideration more information than just the so-called volatility to discover the
absolute market participants' anticipation rather than only its relative one.
