Abstract
Accurate modeling of extreme price changes is vital to financial risk management. We examine
the small sample properties of adaptive tail index estimators under the class of student-t marginal
distribution functions including generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH)
models and propose a model-based bias-corrected estimation approach. Our simulation results
indicate that bias relates to the underlying model and may be positively as well as negatively signed.
The empirical study of daily exchange rate changes reveals substantial differences in measured tail
thickness due to small sample bias. Thus, high quantile estimation may lead to a substantial
underestimation of tail risk.

1. Introduction
Events such as market crashes or cases of individual financial distress regularly point
out the potential effects of fat tails in unconditional return distributions. Empirical
research in finance aims at a careful modeling of such extreme events and at the same
time provides a basis for financial risk management. To this end, extreme value theory

models the asymptotic extreme characteristics of distributions of stationary return series.
Theory allows us to make inferences about return distributions not only within, but also
beyond, the observed range of sample returns and to obtain an adequate characterization
of the extreme behavior of returns. Estimation of the so-called tail index turns out to be
essential, and the theory offers a variety of approaches; see, e.g., Embrechts et al. (1997)
and Coles (2001). Previous studies of the tail index of return distributions include
Dacorogna et al. (1995), Danielsson and de Vries (1997), Huisman et al. (1998, 2001),
Jondeau and Rockinger (1999), Lauridsen (2000), and McNeil and Frey (2000), among
others.
This paper contributes to the empirical finance literature on modeling fat-tailed
distributions of exchange rate changes. It thereby follows the seminal papers by Koedijk
et al. (1990) and Loretan and Phillips (1994) who give results on weekly and daily
exchange rate data, respectively. Based on earlier studies, the student-t specification as
proposed by Clark (1973) was found to provide a suitable model for the distribution of
exchange rate changes. Recent empirical results, e.g., by Bond (2000), indicate that
generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models with student-t
innovations (GARCH-t) are a good benchmark model which is hardly outperformed by
an asymmetric distributional alternative. Hence, we examine the small sample properties
of adaptive tail index estimators under the class of student-t marginal distribution
functions including the ARCH-type dependent case. Kearns and Pagan (1997) point
out that the latter can have a substantial impact on tail index estimation. Based on our
simulation results, we then derive a bias-corrected, adaptive tail index estimation
approach. This approach is based on the GARCH-t model as a prior and has two steps.
In the first step, the GARCH model is estimated as a benchmark model for the overall
exchange rate data, yielding a prior tail index estimate together with its simulated small
sample properties under the model. In the second step, we follow the philosophy of
extreme value theory to ‘‘let the tails speak for themselves’’ and derive the actual estimate
of the tail index of the exchange rate changes only from a subset of extreme sample
observations.
The approaches to tail index estimation which we examine go back to the proposal by
Hill (1975). The Hill estimator has been used widely in financial applications. The approach
is based on the assumption that the underlying distribution is in the maximum domain of
attraction of the Fréchet extreme value distribution. This generally holds for fat-tailed
distributions as they are usually analyzed in finance. Considering alternative estimation
methodologies, we point out that tail index estimation is typically based on maximum
likelihood or other methods of statistical inference jointly with asymptotic arguments from
extreme value theory. The choice of a threshold, which yields a sample fraction of extreme
observations, is essential to the bias/variance trade-off for all estimation procedures.
Comprehensive theoretical arguments for the case of the Hill estimator are given for
example in Segers (2001).
Our simulation results indicate that the interpretation of tail index estimation results in
small samples heavily relies on a what is assumed as a suitable model for the underlying
series. The novelty of our approach is to study effects under general parameterizations of
GARCH(1,1)-t models and to compare them to the independent identically distributed
(iid) student-t case. Recent findings by Gomes and Oliveira (2001) and Matthys and

Beirlant (2000) document the small sample properties of adaptive estimators under
various iid distributional model assumptions also pointing out small sample bias. Based
on our results, we propose a bias-corrected, two-step, GARCH-t model-based, adaptive
estimation approach. In the first step, the GARCH-t model parameters are estimated based
on the overall data set. Numerical integration thereby yields an assessment of the tail
index which may be considered as a raw prior not derived from the tails of the
distribution only. However, this prior together with the underlying GARCH-t model
allows us to simulate the small sample properties of tail index estimates and to derive an
optimal estimator under the model. In the second step, we use a subsample of extreme
sample observations and derive the estimate of the tail index from a series of Hill
estimates given the information from our first step. Using several Hill estimates instead of
just one estimate is also done, e.g., in the regression approach by Huisman et al. (2001).
We follow the approach by Drees et al. (2000) which aims at choosing an estimate of the
tail index within a ‘‘stable’’ region of the so-called Hill plot; see also Embrechts et al.
(1997).
There are two important points which we have to point out regarding related work in the
literature. (i) The proposed procedure allows us to derive unconditional tail estimates for
the marginal distribution of exchange rate returns. An alternative methodology is to model
conditional returns and estimate the model innovations based on a GARCH specification;
see Diebold et al. (1998), McNeil and Frey (2000) and Lauridsen (2000). With our
unconditional approach, we refer to the small sample distributional properties from our
simulations as well as to theoretical results. The theoretical robustness results in Hsing
(1991) and Resnick and Stărică (1998) show that consistency of the Hill estimator is given
not only under independence but also under quite general forms of dependence including
ARCH-type dependence. Ignoring dependence, thereby fitting the tail of the marginal
distribution, has the advantage that the tail estimator is derived from the original data set,
without the disturbing effects of potential misspecification of the conditional model which
may include estimation error and questions of robustness. Furthermore, the vast empirical
findings on ARCH modeling in finance point out that the usefulness of those models lies in
predicting periods of increased, decaying return variance after exogenous shocks to return
variance have occurred. However, risk management in face of extreme events will also be
concerned with unpredictable, i.e., unconditional, shocks to return variance that may cause
large portfolio losses. (ii) The recent literature suggests an increasing number of methods to
reduce estimation bias in Hill estimation applications. An alternative, Hill plot-based,
estimation approach is the Huisman et al. (1998, 2001) regression approach. Although our
method is not restricted to applications under the GARCH-t model, it is indeed more model
specific; that is, it relies on a preassumed suitable model for the underlying series. Huisman
et al. (2001) document favorable small sample properties for their estimator under a
particular given GARCH(1,1) model. Our approach may account for small sample bias
explicitly by taking model parameterization, and hence also taking the magnitude of the tail
index into account. Such a procedure appears appropriate because our simulation results
indicate that, for the estimators studied, small sample bias is sensitive with respect to the
parameters of a particular GARCH specification.
In our empirical investigation, we measure tail thickness for a given sample of daily
US Dollar/Deutschemark (USD/DEM) exchange rate changes. Simulating small sample

168

bias under the fitted GARCH model, we find that bias is a dominant issue to cope with
in financial risk assessment, and therefore we apply our model-based adaptive tail index
estimation approach. Compared to more traditional approaches, our inference indicates a
40% deviation in the estimate of tail thickness. Given the assumption that the class of
student-t distributions is a suitable model, it also implies that the existence of the fourth
and even the third moment of the underlying distribution is questionable; this adds to the
earlier findings by Loretan and Phillips (1994) who used a conventional Hill estimator.
Whereas Huisman et al. (2001) find that tail fatness tends to be overestimated for
weekly exchange rate data, we find that the direction of bias is generally ambiguous. For
our given sample of daily exchange rates, tail fatness turns out to be underestimated by
conventional methods and our method indicates substantially higher risk in the tails of
the exchange rate distribution. This finding also has implications for high quantile
estimation.
Following this introduction, the remainder of the present paper is divided into four
main sections. Section 2 presents an outline of the extreme value methodology. This
includes results on the asymptotics of extremes of iid and ARCH series, the Hill
estimator, a selection of adaptive methods for Hill estimation as well as our biascorrected extension. The adaptive methods used in our study include sequential, bootstrap
and Hill plot-based approaches. Section 3 documents the results of a simulation study for
the estimators’ small sample properties under the class of marginal student-t distributions.
Section 4 contains our empirical study of extreme daily exchange rate changes. Section 5
concludes.

2. The methodological background
2.1. Extreme value theory: the classical case
Classical extreme value theory is concerned with the asymptotic distribution of
standardized maxima from a series of iid random variables (Rt)1 V t V T with a common
distribution function F. Without loss of generality, we assume that the variables Rt denote
time-t log returns of some financial asset in the following. For given normalizing
constants, aT>0, bTaR, and MT = max(R1,. . .,RT), the classical result by Fisher/Tippett
and Gnedenko states that if H exists as the nondegenerate distributional limit of the
standardized maximum



ð2:1Þ

then H(r) is equal to one of three different types of extreme value distributions. The latter
are nested within the so-called generalized extreme value distribution

169

where 1 + nr > 0. The shape parameter, naR, also denoted as tail index, characterizes the
extreme behavior of the distribution function.
Condition (2.1) states that F belongs to the maximum domain of attraction of Hn,
FaMDA(Hn). Fat-tailed distribution functions, which are of interest in financial applications, particularly belong to the maximum domain of attraction of the Fréchet type extreme
value distribution, FaMDA(Un), where Un(r) = exp(r1/n), r > 0, n > 0. From a theorem
by Gnedenko, it is well known that the condition FaMDA(Un) is satisfied if and only if

the tail F (r) = 1F(r) of the distribution function F is regularly varying at infinity with
parameter 1/n < 0, i.e.
FðrÞ ¼ LðrÞr1=n ;

ð2:3Þ

r > 0;

where the function L(r) is slowly varying at infinity:

s > 0:

2.2. Extreme value theory: ARCH-type dependence
Extreme value theory for iid series can be extended to the case where the variables
(Rt)1 V t V T have a stationary marginal distribution F. We consider the case of ARCH which
is a well-known model class for nonlinear dependence in financial time series (see, e.g.,
Bollerslev et al., 1992). A detailed discussion of ARCH as a model for exchange rate
changes is given in Diebold (1988).
Assuming a constant expectation and excess returns Rt with a conditional time-varying
variance r2t , the prominent GARCH(1,1) process has the representation:
Rt ¼ rt Zt ;
r2t ¼ b0 þ b1 R2t1 þ b2 r2t1 ;

b0 ; b1 ; b2 z0:

ð2:4Þ

The random variables Zt are standardized iid draws from some symmetric, possibly fattailed, distribution function with density g(z): RiR+. In our simulation study and in the
empirical application, g(z) will be given by the student-t density with maN degrees of
freedom. This yields the GARCH(1,1)-t(m) model.
As outlined, e.g., in Mikosch and Stărică (2000) and the literature given therein, a
stationary marginal distribution F for the GARCH(1,1) process [Eq. (2.4)] exists if
Z l
lnAb1 z2 þ b2 AgðzÞdz < 0;
b0 > 0:
ð2:5Þ
l

It can then be shown that the tail index n of the stationary marginal distribution F is
given as a solution to an integral equation such that
FðrÞfcr1=n ;

r > 0;

c > 0; as r ! l;

170

N. Wagner, T.A. Marsh / Journal of Empirical Finance 12 (2005) 165–185

which relates to the implication of result [Eq. (2.3)] from the previous section. For the
ARCH(1) process, solutions for the tail index are discussed in de Haan et al. (1989). For
the GARCH(1,1) process [Eq. (2.4)], the tail index n can be determined numerically as a
solution to the following integral equation:2

2.3. Semiparametric tail index estimation
The above results show that the upper3 tail of a fat-tailed marginal distribution F
behaves asymptotically like the tail of the Pareto distribution. For the latter, given the order
statistics RT,T V . . . V Rk,T V R1,T, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of n is given by
n̂k;T ¼

k
1X
lnRi;T  lnRk;T ;
k i¼1

ð2:7Þ

where k = T. As the series (Rt)1 V t V T has a stationary marginal distribution which behaves

only asymptotically Pareto-like, F (r) f cr1/f as r ! l, optimality of the MLE [Eq.
(2.7)] does not apply.
2.3.1. Asymptotic tail behavior: where does the tail begin?
Hill (1975) proposed a conditional MLE approach. Based on a known high threshold
u > 0, let model (2.3) hold for r > u. Given that k is a realization of K=#{i: Ri,T > u},
select a subsample of k < T largest observations in Eq. (2.7) and the Hill estimator is given
as an MLE of n conditional on u. The number k = k(T) of order statistics should increase
with the overall sample size T, while on the other hand, it should be small relative to the
overall sample size T. In the literature this is frequently made precise by the condition
kðT Þ ! l;

kðT Þ=T ! 0; as T ! l:

ð2:8Þ

Under model (2.3) and condition (2.8), the Hill estimator can be shown to have
following properties: (i) the estimator is consistent (see, e.g., Embrechts et al., 1997,
Example 4.1.12); (ii) under additional assumptions on the asymptotic tail behavior of F,
asymptotic normality follows
pﬃﬃﬃ
d
k ðn̂k;T  nÞ ! N ðBn ; n2 Þ;

ð2:9Þ

where Bn denotes some asymptotic bias term (see, e.g., DeHaan and Peng, 1998; Segers,
2001); (iii) the Hill estimator obtains a theoretically derived optimal rate of convergence,
2

This result is based on a set of regularity conditions as well as on the assumption that the tail of the
innovations is thinner than that of the conditional standard deviation of the GARCH process; see, e.g., Mikosch
and Stărică (2000) for details.
3
The focus on the upper tail is an arbitrary choice. The results hold equivalently for the lower tail because
min(R1,. . .,RT) =  max(  R1,. . .,  RT).

N. Wagner, T.A. Marsh / Journal of Empirical Finance 12 (2005) 165–185

171

being superior to other popular estimators proposed in the literature (see Drees, 1998); (iv)
the results by Hsing (1991) indicate that the Hill estimator is asymptotically quite robust
with respect to deviations from independence; Resnick and Stărică (1998) prove
consistency under ARCH-type dependence.
Several approaches to the determination of an optimal sample fraction k(T)for the Hill
estimator have been studied. Theoretical results on an optimal bias/variance trade-off can
be derived using the asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) as the optimality criterion.
The results are based on the so-called Hall model, which forms a generalization of the
Pareto model. It imposes a second-order condition on the asymptotic behavior of the tail of
the distribution function F. By assuming L(r) = c1[1 + c2rq/n + o(rq/n)] in Eq. (2.3) it
follows that
FðrÞ ¼ c1 r1=n ð1 þ c2 rq=n þ oðrq=n ÞÞ;

as r ! l;

ð2:10Þ

where c1 > 0, c2aR and q > 0. The above model gives an asymptotic characterization of
the tail of the underlying distribution and at the same time robustifies the semiparametric
estimation approach against deviations from the exact Pareto tail. The model holds for
distribution functions such as the Fréchet and the student-t.
We consider two Hill-based adaptive tail index estimation approaches. Both approaches
rely on model (2.10) and select an MSE optimal sample fraction k.
Drees and Kaufmann (1998) derive a sequential estimator of the optimal k by extending
previous theoretical work on the asymptotic bias and variance of the Hill estimator. A
stopping time criterion for a sequence of Hill estimators is used in order to approximate the
number of upper order statistics k under which the bias
pﬃ in the Hill estimator starts to
dominate the maximum random fluctuation of the series iAn̂i;T  nA; 2ViVk; given some
threshold uT>0:

kðuT Þ ¼ min k a f2; . . . ; T g : max iAn̂i;T  n̂k;T A > uT :
2ViVk

The second-order parameter q in (1.7) is either set equal to a constant or given by a
consistent estimator such as

ð2:11Þ

2ViVkðuT Þ

where ka(0,1) and [x] denotes the largest integer smaller or equal to x. Then, for a given q
and a consistent initial estimator of n, a consistent estimator of the optimal k is derived.
The procedure yields a Hill estimator with minimal asymptotic MSE (Drees and
Kaufmann, 1998, Theorem 1).
Dacorogna et al. (1995) as well as Danielsson and de Vries (1997) and Danielsson et al.
(2001) use a subsample bootstrap approach derived from Hall (1990) to estimate the

172

N. Wagner, T.A. Marsh / Journal of Empirical Finance 12 (2005) 165–185

optimal sample fraction. The approach is based on bootstrap subsamples of size T1 < T.
The estimate of the optimal subsample fraction can be derived from
* 1  ñT Þ2 AðR1 ; . . . ; RT ÞÞ;
k̂1 ¼ arg min Êððn̂k;T
1VkVT1

ð2:12Þ

where * denotes estimates based on resamples drawn from (R1,. . .,RT). ñT denotes a
consistent initial Hill estimator. The expectation operator is approximated by a given
number of bootstrap runs. Instead of applying the bootstrap to the MSE of the Hill
estimator directly as in Eq. (2.12), an asymptotically equivalent criterion which does not
depend on the choice of an initial estimator is proposed in Danielsson et al. (2001). Their
alternative bootstrap estimate is given by4
	


* 1  2ðn̂*k;T1 Þ2 Þ2 AðR1 ; . . . ; RT Þ ;
ð2:13Þ
k̂1 ¼ arg min Ê ðMk;T
1Vk<T1

where Mk,T, k < T, is a second-order moment estimator of the form:
Mk;T ¼

k
1X
ðln Ri;T  ln Rkþ1;T Þ2 :
k i¼1

The estimate for the optimal overall sample fraction kopt can then, most simply as in
Hall (1990) and Danielsson and de Vries (1997), be derived from:
h
i
k̂opt ¼ k̂1 ðT =T1 Þ2q=ð2qþ1Þ :
ð2:14Þ
Again, the second-order parameter q is either, e.g., estimated by Eq. (2.11) or set equal
to a constant.
2.3.2. Hill plot-based estimation and optimal scaling
A different class of Hill-based adaptive tail index estimation approaches is based on a
series of Hill estimates
fðk; n̂k;T Þ : 1VkVT g;

ð2:15Þ

also denoted as Hill plot. We apply the consistent estimator by Drees et al. (2000) which is
based on the frequent recommendation of choosing an estimate of the tail index within a
‘‘stable’’ region of the Hill plot. Rescaling the axis of the number of upper order statistics k
by a continuous parameter u, yields the so-called alternative Hill plot proposed by Resnick
and Stărică (1997)
fðu; n̂½T u ;T Þ : 0VuV1g:

ð2:16Þ

When the underlying distribution is not exactly Paretian, Drees et al. (2000) show
that superior properties of the estimator result under the alternative Hill plot [Eq.
4
In case the maximum sample realization is drawn at least twice in a bootstrap resample, the MSE equivalent
criterion yields a zero value for k = 1 (and possibly for k>1), whereas the MSE criterion yields the squared initial
estimator. We enter the squared initial estimator value in this case.

(2.16)] as compared to the standard plot [Eq. (2.15)]; hence, we use the corresponding
estimator
Z u
n̂m;T ¼ arg max
1f½T u 1=2 An̂½T u ;T nAVmñT g du;
ð2:17Þ
n>0

with an upper boundary 0 < ū < 1 and a scaling constant m>0. The parameter n˜T
denotes a consistent initial Hill estimator which is used as an estimate of the standard
deviation of the alternative Hill plot, [Tu]1/2n, for varying u; see also Eq. (2.9).
The estimator defined by Eq. (2.17) is denoted maximal occupation time (MOT)
estimator. Thereby, occupation in a neighborhood of some tail index value is defined by an
interval, which is constructed from the standard deviation of the Hill estimator times the
scaling constant m. The sensitivity of the tail index estimator [Eq. (2.17)] with respect to m
can be visualized by what may be labelled a MOT plot
fðm; n̂m;T Þ : 0 < m < lg:

ð2:18Þ

As we are facing a bias/variance trade-off in Eq. (2.9), an optimal choice of m will not
only consider estimation variance but also estimation bias. We therefore propose an MSEbased method for choosing m given model estimates which provide information about the
underlying distribution function F.
In particular, assume that the marginal distribution function F is given by the dynamics
of a GARCH(1,1) model according to Eq. (2.4) where the stationarity condition (2.5)
holds. Given the parameters h of the GARCH model, let the variable n¯T>0 denote the tail
index which follows as a solution to I(n) = 0 according to Eq. (2.6). An MSE optimal
scaling constant m conditional on the model point estimates is then given as:
	


m ¼ arg min Ê ðn̂m;T  n̄T Þ2 AĥT :
maG

ð2:19Þ

In applications, the optimal m>0 can be determined by a grid search within a set GoR+
and a set of discrete values for the parameter u in Eq. (2.17). The expectation operator is
approximated by a given number of independent Monte Carlo simulation runs. Based on
the MSE optimal scaling constant, n̂m,T serves as a model-based optimal MOT estimator of
the tail index.

3. Small sample performance of tail index estimators
In the previous section we gave a summary of theoretical results on the Hill estimator
showing that the estimator has favorable asymptotic properties under quite general model
assumptions. However, there remain open questions in small samples where the asymptotic results may only give a crude approximation to the estimator’s true sampling
properties. In particular, little is known about how ARCH-type dependence influences
the bias component and the bias/variance trade-off under adaptive subsample selection

174

criteria. In this section, we perform a simulation study on the small sample performance of
the Hill estimators outlined above.
Previous simulation studies, e.g., by Gomes and Oliveira (2001) and Matthys and
Beirlant (2000) compare different adaptive estimation procedures under iid variables.
They document the small sample properties of the procedures pointing out small
sample bias. Turning to dependent series, the special case of an integrated GARCH
(IGARCH) process, which implies infinite unconditional second moments, is discussed
in Kearns and Pagan (1997). Huisman et al. (2001) give simulation results on their
estimator under a GARCH(1,1) model with typical parameterization and normal
innovations.
The general class of ‘‘nearly integrated’’, stationary GARCH(1,1) models with student-t
innovations is studied in the following. Table 1 contains an overview of the return models
for our simulation study. The models include the iid symmetric student-t(m) return model
(‘‘stud/n’’) as well as the GARCH(1,1) return generating process (2.4) with student-t(m)
innovations (‘‘arch/n’’). The tail indices n for the latter model are calculated by solving Eq.
(2.6). Note that the model parameters are chosen such that the tail indices of the marginal
distributions are approximately equal to those of the iid student models. When studying
the properties of the tail index estimators, this allows us to distinguish between the effects
of the magnitude of the tail index on one hand and ARCH-type dependence on the other
hand. Referring to empirical evidence from GARCH estimation in finance, the parameters
b1 and b2 are chosen such that b1 + b241; that is, the models are what may be called
‘‘nearly integrated’’.
3.1. Estimator settings and definitions
In order to characterize the small sample properties of the various adaptive Hill
estimators presented above, we study the estimators’ error distributions and particularly
their root mean squared error in a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Without loss of
generality, the sample size T will be defined as the number of positive sample observations
from the upper distribution tail. We exploit the property that all our return models are
based on distribution functions which are symmetric around zero by simulating T
observations and taking absolute values. The corresponding overall size of a sample of
observed returns will then equal T if one assumes symmetry or N = 2T if one is interested
in inferences about each of both tails separately.

The adaptive estimators that were outlined in Section 2.3 above require the choice of
several variables, where we rely on the suggestions made in the literature. Altogether,
four different estimators are calculated: H-INI, H-DK, H-BS, and H-MOT. The initial
estimator, ñT ¼ n̂½2pﬃﬃTﬃ;T ; is given as a naive estimator labelled H-INI. Following Drees
and Kaufmann (1998), the second-order parameter q in the asymptotic tail expansion [Eq.
(2.10)] is estimated by Eq. (2.11) with k = 0.6, estimator H-DK. For the bootstrap
approach we choose the subsample sizes T1=[T/10] as in Danielsson and de Vries (1997).
The asymptotically MSE-equivalent criterion proposed by Danielsson et al. (2001) is
chosen, which yields an optimal subsample fraction according to Eq. (2.13). Handling the
second-order parameter q as in the Drees/Kaufmann approach, Eq. (2.14) yields the
estimated optimal sample fraction and the estimator H-BS. For the Drees et al. (2000)
maximum occupation time estimator [Eq. (2.17)], the continuous parameter u is
approximated by a grid with stepsize 0.05, where the upper bound ū = ln([T/2])/ln(T)
corresponds to k V [T/2]. Together with the standard scaling constant m = 1, this defines
the estimate H-MOT.
3.2. Simulation results
Given the six return models from Table 1, our simulations are based on time series
samples of two different sizes: (i) a shorter sample with T = 500 upper tail observations
(corresponds to N = 1000 observations) and (ii) a longer sample with T = 1500 upper tail
observations (corresponds to N = 3000 observations). We report mean error (ME), standard
deviation (STD) and root mean squared error (RMSE) where all our simulation results are
based on 500 independent simulation runs, under each of which 100 bootstrap runs are
performed for calculating the bootstrap estimator H-BS. The results for T = 500 are given
in Table 2, the results for T = 1500 are given in Table 3. Our conclusions from the
simulations are given in the following subsections.

Mean error (ME), standard deviation (STD), and root mean squared error (RMSE), T = 1500.

RMSE statistics for the estimators.5 This decrease in RMSE with an increase in n
deserves further
consideration recalling that MSE = STD2 + ME2. With, for example
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kðT Þ ¼ ½2 T  and sample size T = 1500, the asymptotic standard deviations are 0.019
for n = 0.17, 0.028 for n = 0.25 and 0.038 for n = 0.33, respectively. In Table 3, the
corresponding simulated standard deviations for the initial estimator H-INI are 0.028,
0.033 and 0.041, respectively; that is, particularly under the smaller tail indices, the
standard deviations have not yet reached their asymptotic bounds. The observation that
the RMSE remains stable or even decreases for increasing tail index n is therefore partly
explainable by a slower convergence to the asymptotic standard deviations for models
with small tail index. The main explanation of our findings, however, is the behavior of
the sample bias (ME). A decreasing absolute bias tends to more than compensate for
increasing estimation variance.6
In summary, these results indicate that the bias/variance trade-off is complex with small
sample bias playing an important role in overall small sample estimation precision. While
estimation STD increases for larger values of the tail index, this is not necessarily the case
for estimation MSE.
3.2.2. GARCH vs. iid student models
In comparing the results for the iid student-t and GARCH models, a first glance at the
tables may lead to the conclusion that there is a relatively high overall mean squared error
robustness of the tail index estimators with respect to heteroskedasticity. Again, as in the
case of increases in the magnitude of the tail index n in the preceding section, unchanged
or even improved RMSE results under GARCH come from a compensating effect of a
reduction in estimation bias ME. ARCH-type volatility clustering leads to clustering in the
extremes which increases estimation error for the tail index. This is confirmed by our
results when we look at the STD statistics of the estimators which mostly show a notable
increase in estimation variance under GARCH.
5
For example, in Table 2, the RMSE for the bootstrap estimator H-BS is 0.080 for the student-t model with
n = 0.17 and 0.071 for the student-t model with n = 0.33. The RMSE for the initial Hill estimator H-INI is 0.091
for the student-t model with n = 0.17 and declines by roughly a third to 0.063 when the tail index is nearly
doubled to n = 0.33.
6
For example, in the case mentioned in the previous footnote, when RMSE falls from 0.091 to 0.063, we see
that the bias falls from 0.087 to 0.048, more than offsetting the increase in standard deviation from 0.028 to 0.041.

177

An interesting finding in the tables is that the MOT estimator’s sample variance is
relatively large under iid student-t data, but is hardly affected by ARCH-type dependence.
This robustness characteristic under dependence appears to be due to the construction of
the estimator based on an entire series of Hill estimators.
3.2.3. Increasing the sample size
Comparing the results for the sample size T = 500 in Table 2 with those for the sample
size T = 1500 in Table 3 indicates that the relative performance ranking of the estimation
approaches under the student-t and GARCH models is basically unaffected by an increase
in the sample size. M-MOT and M-BS achieve the best RMSE results irrespective of
sample size. Apart from that, the results suggest that an increased sample size yields larger
performance improvements for the bootstrap as compared to the maximum occupation
time estimator.
Considering estimation precision as measured by STD, an increase in the sample size
causes improvements in the estimators’ standard deviations, especially under the iid
student-t model with a small tail index. Interestingly, there is a notable difference in the
reduction of estimation variance between the GARCH and the iid models. Under the
GARCH models with n = 0.25 and n = 0.33 the standard deviation of the Hill estimator can
hardly be improved by increasing the sample size. This shows that the convergence to the
asymptotic lower bounds for the estimator’s standard deviation can be very slow under
ARCH-type dependence in the data. Hence, large sample sizes may be considered a
necessary although not sufficient condition for a successful application of tail estimation
procedures.
3.2.4. Comparing the estimation approaches
Although, it is impossible to conclude from our simulation results that a particular
estimator under consideration is dominant, the bootstrap and the maximum occupation
time approach seem to be appropriate choices for parameter estimation in small samples.
The H-BS shows advantages under the increased sample size. The H-MOT estimation
approach is less sensitive with respect to sample size and ARCH-type dependence.7
Interestingly, it turns out that all the approaches show a common tendency to be
positively biased for smaller values of the tail index. Under the GARCH models, there is
also a tendency towards negative bias for larger values of the tail index especially for the
MOT estimator.8 Hence, bias as a function of n appears to be a critical issue in tail index
estimation in that it causes the estimated degree of fat-tailedness to be systematically
biased. In order to reduce such potential small sample bias, the model-based optimal MOT
estimator defined by Eqs. (2.17) and (2.19) will be applied to exchange rate data in the
following. Inferring a priori knowledge about the approximate magnitude of the tail index,
we thereby simulate the small sample properties of our estimation approach under
GARCH.
7
The simulation results in Wagner and Marsh (2000) indicate that slightly dominant overall small sample
results can be obtained by replacing the Hill estimator with a Hill-derived moment ratio estimator. A detailed
discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.
8
The simulation results for a GARCH model with n>0.33 in the following section confirm this conclusion.

4. Empirical study of extreme exchange rate changes
The preceding simulations made obvious that the small sample properties of the Hill
estimator depend critically on our assumption of the underlying return model. In particular,
not only estimation variance but also bias depend on the magnitude of the tail index both
being also affected by potential ARCH effects.
In this section, we study these effects for a given data set of daily changes in the
exchange rate of one US Dollar vs. Deutschemarks (USD/DEM). We proceed in three
steps. First, based on the prior assumption that a GARCH(1,1)-t(m) specification is a
suitable model for the given exchange rate dynamics, GARCH model parameter
estimation is carried out. Second, we perform a simulation study of tail index estimation
small sample properties under the specific model and derive the model-based optimal
MOT estimator. Finally, the tail index of the marginal distribution of our exchange rate
changes is estimated. The three-step procedure allows us to calibrate the MOT estimator
under the assumed model while maintaining a general approach to tail index estimation
based on extreme value theory. The estimation results obtained are compared to those of a
bootstrap approach.
4.1. The data and GARCH model estimation
The empirical investigation is based on logarithmic changes rt, t = 1,. . .,T, in daily USD/
DEM exchange rates during the period 1988 –1994. This series contains T = 1716 nonzero
observations as obtained from Datastream. The pre-EURO sample period was chosen as a
period of exchange rates without severe exogenous policy impact or structural breaks
which makes the assumption of a stationary underlying distribution plausible. Fig. 1 plots
the logarithmic exchange rates changes in the sample period.

Start values were obtained from fitting the model under the assumption of normally distributed innovations;

Estimation of the GARCH model with student-t innovations [Eq. (2.4)] is carried out by
maximum likelihood as outlined in Hamilton (1994), where the parameter vector is given
by h=(b0,b1,b2,m). The parameter estimation results are given in Table 4. As typically
observed for GARCH estimation in finance, all estimates differ from zero at high
confidence levels and the sum of the point estimates is close to, but smaller than, one.
The maximum likelihood estimate of m turns out to be close to 6.9
4.2. Small sample error simulation
The simulation of the sample properties of the Hill estimators is carried out for the
estimated GARCH(1,1)-t(m) model. Given our above point estimates and setting m = 6, the
stationarity condition (2.5) for the GARCH model can be verified numerically. Solving the
integral Eq. (2.6) results in a theoretical model tail index n¯T = 0.41. This theoretical tail
index gives an approximate prior estimate of the tail index of the marginal distribution of
the exchange rate changes. Under a sample size of T = 1716 we then simulate the error
distributions of the bootstrap estimator H-BS and the maximum occupation time estimator
 for the optimal H-MOT
MOT.10 Additionally, we determine the optimal scaling factor m
estimator by minimizing Eq. (2.19) via a grid search. The grid for varying m is thereby set
as G={1,1.5,. . .,10} where 250 Monte Carlo runs approximate MSE in Eq. (2.19) for each
grid element.
As in Section 3, Table 5 reports the mean error (ME), the standard deviation of the
errors (STD) and the square root of the mean squared errors (RMSE) of the estimation
approaches under 500 independent Monte Carlo runs. The simulation results reveal a
negative bias for all estimation approaches; that is, all estimators underestimate tail
thickness for the given GARCH(1,1)-t(m) model. The maximum occupation time estimator
with MSE optimal scaling factor m̄ = 5.5 substantially reduces bias under the simulated
model.

9
GARCH model estimation diagnostics indicate a good fit of the GARCH model; these include QQ-plots as
well as autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation and Ljung-Box statistics for the model residuals and the squared
model residuals. Note that in the latter case, standard confidence levels are conservative under nonexistence of
the fourth moment of the underlying return distribution. Detailed results are available from the authors upon
request.
10
All estimator and simulation settings remain unchanged from Section 3. Only for computational
simplification, the second-order parameter q was set equal to one in simulating the bootstrap estimation approach.
Simulation results unreported here indicate equivalent small sample performance. Refer to Wagner and Marsh
(2000) for details.

4.3. Estimation results
We now turn back to our sample of exchange rate changes and examine the tail
behavior for the absolute changes ArtA, t = 1,. . .,1716. A classical Hill plot [Eq. (2.15)] for
the series is given in Fig. 2. As is well known, time series dependence strongly influences
the properties of the Hill plot. Obviously, the plot in Fig. 2 does not converge against some
limit as k becomes larger and positive bias enters in the estimates of n. As our simulation
results indicate, the Hill estimates may also exhibit bias in that the entire Hill plot is shifted
upward or downward which may well be due to the nonlinear dependence in the data.11
Apart from these difficulties, visual inspection of the plot reveals a nearly flat area of
Hill estimates with moderate variability in an interval roughly between k = 60 and k = 90. A
classical approach would be to choose an estimator from that range which would imply a
tail index estimate in the interval [0.25;0.27]. A glance at the alternative Hill plot [Eq.
(2.16)] in Fig. 3 indicates that rescaling the Hill plot for small values of k reveals a flat area
for ua[0.2;0.4] which relates to ka[4;20]. Note that choosing k = 20 would yield a tail
index estimate of about 0.18.
The above discussion makes obvious that it seems quite difficult to decide on the
choice of a subsample fraction for the given data set via graphical methods alone. The
results for the adaptive, i.e., data driven, Hill estimation results are summarized in Table
6. The bootstrap estimator H-BS yields results similar to our visual inspection for the
standard Hill plot. The choice of an optimal subsample fraction k = 84 yields an estimate
of 0.25; a result which happens to be nearly identical to that by the H-INI estimator. The
maximum occupation time estimators’ behavior corresponds well to our previous
simulation results: H-MOT with m = 10 for example, yields a larger estimate of a n
than H-MOT with m = 3 which again is larger than the estimate by H-MOT with m = 1.
This is due to the observation that as k becomes larger, positive bias enters in the Hill
plot. The application of our model-based MSE optimal MOT estimator yields a tail index
estimate of 0.35 indicating a 40% deviation in the estimate of tail thickness as compared
to the results mentioned above. For a sensitivity analysis of our result, we refer to Fig. 4.

The given MOT plot appears to be quite stable for a wide range of scaling factors
ma[2;8] including our choice of m̄. All these scaling factors yield tail index estimates
equal to or, mostly, substantially larger than 0.25.
When using estimates of 1/n as an indication of the existence of higher order moments,
one should therefore rather doubt the existence of the forth moment of the underlying
distribution F. Once we conclude that the tail index for the exchange rate changes is
potentially larger than 0.33, we would even doubt the existence of the third moment of the
underlying distribution, although an interpretation of traditional results would not yield
such implication.

Our findings also have implications for high quantile estimation. Under tail symmetry,

where the sample size T of upper tail observations is corrected by the number c>0 of zero

exchange rate changes. For the subsample size we choose k = 84 as given by H-BS (which
could be replaced by other choices); that is, we model a fraction of approximately 5% of
the largest absolute exchange rate changes. Table 7 reports quantile estimates r̂p for
different probabilities and tail index estimates. The quantile estimates indicate that the
95% quantile estimate is robust under differences in estimates of the tail index; the five in a
hundred day quantile is estimated to equal roughly 1.4%. Moving to the higher probability
levels indicates economically significant differences in estimated quantiles. Under a tail
estimate of 0.35, the one in a hundred day estimated quantile increases from a 2.1%

5. Conclusion
This paper focused on measuring tail thickness of the marginal distribution of
stationary ARCH-type financial time series. By the very nature of extreme value theory,
small sample bias and variance play an important role in estimation. Our simulation
study documents that measuring tail thickness relies on proper assumptions about the
underlying return model and its time series properties; that is, what tail index estimation
results tell us about the extreme behavior of the returns cannot be separated from a
priori assumptions. An example is the interpretation of classical methods such as the
Hill plot which should be treated with care given the dependence structure in financial
data.
Hence, while extreme value theory offers a general methodology for specifically
modeling the distribution tails, suitable modeling of the overall data remains essential
in practical applications where a limited amount of independent data is available. One
practical approach was outlined here. A drawback of the approach is that it is
relatively cumbersome because it requires a preanalysis of the financial time series
which may even be extended by additional exploratory methods. It follows that the
estimation results will not be readily available; once they are available, they are
subject to prior judgement. Further integration of models of the overall time series
with models of the tails seems an interesting issue to address in future work on
extremes in finance.
