Abstract
Fama and French’s (1992) assertion that investors receive premium payments for risk
associated with the book value to market price (BE/ME) and size and not for holding beta risk
has sparked a lively debate concerning risk factors that are priced in the market. Howton and
Peterson (1998) use a dual-beta model to test the Fama and French conclusions. They conclude
that the significant relationship between beta and returns depends on the use of the dual-beta
model. This work, however, ignores the results reported by Pettengill, Sundaram, and Mathur
(PSM, 1995). PSM find a significant relation between a constant risk beta and returns when
data are segmented between up and down markets, but do not consider the impact of size and
BE/ME. In this paper we show that the PSM (1995) market segmentation procedure alone
provides a sufficient condition to identify a significant relation between beta and returns in

1. Introduction
Fama and French (1992) study the ability of various market variables to explain
cross-sectional returns of common stocks. They find that market value of equity and
the ratio of book value to market value of equity (BE/ME) explain a significant proportion of the variation in cross-sectional returns. In contrast, they find that systematic
risk as measured by beta is not related to returns. These results lead Fama and French
to conclude that firm size and BE/ME proxy for risk, but that the market does not
reward investors for holding systematic risk as measured by beta. This research has
engendered an active debate centered on the nature of the risk-return relationship in
the equity market.
Included in the risk-return debate are studies that argue that the beta measures
used by Fama and French (1992) are mis-specified.1 Several studies build upon
early work by Fabozzi and Francis (1977), who estimate separate betas over bull and
bear markets. Wiggins (1992) finds that the Fabozzi and Francis dual-beta model
improves return predictions for portfolios formed by size, past beta, and historic
return performance. Bhardwaj and Brooks (1993) extend this work by examining the
size effect using a dual-beta market model. They conclude that “small firm stocks
underperform large firm stocks when beta risk is allowed to vary in bull and bear
markets” (p. 270).
Howton and Peterson (1998) (hereafter HP) provide a more direct test of the Fama
and French conclusions. They employ the dual-beta asset-pricing model of Bhardwaj
and Brooks (1993) to test the relation between beta and realized stock returns in the
presence of size, BE/ME, and other market variables. Unlike Bhardwaj and Brooks
(1993), they find a significant size effect, and in contrast to Fama and French (1992),
they find that beta provides a significant explanation of the cross-sectional returns.
The relation between beta and returns becomes significant only when the sample
is segmented between bull and bear markets. HP (1998) argue that the significant
relationship between beta and returns results from their use of bull and bear betas
rather than constant-risk betas. Their study, however, ignores the work of Pettengill,
Sundaram, and Mathur (1995), hereafter labeled PSM.

1 Other studies that argue that beta measures are mis-specified include: Kothari, Shanken, and Sloan (1995),
who argue that when beta is estimated using annual returns a significant relationship exists between beta
and returns; and Jagannathan and Wang (1996), who argue that a significant relationship exists between
beta and returns if beta is allowed to vary over time.

PSM (1995) argue that the capital asset pricing model postulates a positive
relationship between beta and expected returns. Empirical tests of this relationship
such as those conducted by Fama and French (1992) use realized returns instead
of expected returns. PSM (1995) argue for a conditional relation between beta and
realized returns: a positive relation between beta and realized returns in up markets
(where market risk premium (Rm − Rf ) is >0), and a negative relation between beta
and realized returns in down markets (where market risk premium (Rm − Rf ) is <0).
They find a significant relation between realized returns and constant-risk betas when
the sample is segmented into up and down markets. This paper shows that the market
segmentation procedure of PSM (1995) is a sufficient condition to demonstrate a
significant relationship between beta and returns. Although the use of bull and bear
market betas as reported by HP (1998) may provide important information concerning
the risk-return puzzle, bull and bear market betas are not a necessary condition to find
a significant relation between beta and returns.
Extant literature on the conditional relation between beta and realized returns
and the dual-beta asset-pricing model are discussed in the next section. Section 3
describes the sample and methodology and section 4 reports the empirical results.
Section 5 discusses the implications of the findings relative to risk payment and
market efficiency, and the conclusion summarizes the findings and identifies possible
areas for further research.

2. Literature review
2.1. Conditional relation between beta and realized returns
Fama and French (1992) reject the idea that high-beta securities receive a riskpremium payment because the average value of monthly regression coefficients from
regressing returns on beta is not significantly different from zero. PSM (1995) contend
that this finding results from the conditional relationship between beta and realized
returns. They argue that high-risk securities should receive a premium payment only
under certain market conditions and should exhibit greater risk by earning a negative
premium payment under other market conditions. The type of market condition under
which these premiums are paid (but not their occurrence) should be identifiable on
an a priori basis. PSM (1995) argue that high beta securities should have higher
returns than low beta securities only in up markets and should exhibit higher risk
by having lower returns in down markets. In support of this hypothesis, they find a
highly significant positive relationship between beta and returns in up markets and
a highly significant negative relationship between beta and returns in down markets.
In addition, they compare average beta and average returns for twenty portfolios
sorted by beta over 660 months and find a significant and direct relationship that they
interpret as payment for systematic risk.
A number of studies have confirmed the presence of a conditional relation between beta and returns in international equity markets. Fletcher (1997) examines

126

G. Pettengill et al./The Financial Review 37 (2002) 123–136

this conditional relation in U.K. stock returns for the period 1975–1994. He finds a
significant conditional relationship between beta and returns. However, this relation
is not symmetrical in up markets and down markets. Similarly, Hodoshima, GarzaGomez, and Kunimura (2000) find a significant conditional relation between beta
and returns when examining the stocks listed in the first section of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange for the period 1957–1995. Isakov (1999) also tests the conditional relation
between beta and returns in a study of the Swiss stock market. He finds a significant
positive relation between beta and returns in up markets and a significant negative
relation between beta and returns in down markets. Likewise, Ho (2001) finds a
significant conditional relation between beta and returns for the Honk Kong market.
These studies together provide a strong argument in favor of the conditional relation
between beta and realized returns as argued by PSM (1995).

2.2. Dual-beta asset pricing model
Wiggins (1992) employs the dual-beta model developed by Fabozzi and Francis
(1977) to examine the relation between beta and returns for portfolios formed by size.
Wiggins finds that the dual-beta model provides a better description of the monthly
cross-sectional returns than that provided with a constant-risk beta. His results also
show a significant relation between size and betas, in particular that down market
betas are greater than up market betas for large firms and that down market betas are
smaller than up market betas for small firms.
Bhardwaj and Brooks (1993) extend this work by examining the size effect
using a dual-beta market model (bull and bear market betas). They find significant
differences in both systematic risk and abnormal returns on firm-size based portfolios.
Their results indicate that when a dual-beta model is used to adjust for risk differences
in bull and bear markets, large firms on average earn significant positive excess returns
and small firms on average earn negative excess returns.
HP (1998) use the dual-beta model of Bhardwaj and Brooks (1993) to examine
the relation between stock returns, bull and bear market betas and other market variables. HP (1998) report higher average betas in up markets than in down markets. In
addition, they find a significant relation between bull and bear market betas and stock
returns. This relation remains significant in the presence of other variables such as
size, BE/ME, and earnings-price ratio. The authors argue that this result is attributed
to the dual-beta model, which allows beta to vary in bull and bear markets, in contrast
to a constant-risk beta model. They also find that book-to-market equity and size are
significantly related to returns primarily in bear markets.

3. Data and methodology
This study tests the argument of HP (1998) that the significant relation between
beta and returns results from the use of bull and bear betas. We do so by contrasting the
relationship between dual-betas and returns and constant-risk betas and returns using

market segmentation procedures. In making this comparison we include BE/ME and
size in our analysis, based on Fama and French’s (1992) conclusion that firm size
and BE/ME proxy for risk. Our basic methodology, which closely follows the Fama
and French (1992) framework, utilizes the returns data for equity securities of nonfinancial firms included on the CRSP NYSE/AMEX/Nasdaq tape.
To allow comparison with the findings of HP (1998) we use a similar sample
period. Data on BE/ME and size are collected annually from Research Insights (Compustat) for the period 1974 through 1994.2 Data are obtained from both the Active and
the Research files. The values for BE/ME and size are used in the set of 12 monthly
regressions from July of year t through June of year t + 1. The first set of regressions occurs for the period July 1975 through June 1976 and the last set of monthly
regressions occurs from July 1993 through June 1994. Following Fama and French
(1992), for each security for each of the above 12-month periods, we assign BE/ME
as the month-end value for December of year t − 1 and firm size as the month-end
equity value for June of year t. Also, following French and Fama (1992), we drop
all observations with negative BE/ME. In addition, we eliminate observations with
BE/ME values greater than 10.3 Subject to these restrictions, our sample includes all
securities for which CRSP and Research Insights data are available.
Betas used in the monthly regressions result from the assignment of portfolio
betas to each security in a particular size-beta portfolio. At the end of each June,
100 portfolios with an approximately equal number of observations are formed using
a size-beta sort.4 Securities are first sorted into ten portfolios by size, as measured by
market value at the end of June. Following the initial sort, each of the ten size-decile
portfolios is sorted into ten sub-portfolios by security beta.
These security betas are estimated prior to portfolio assignment by regressing
security returns on market returns over the 60 months prior to portfolio formation. The
equally-weighted NYSE/AMEX CRSP index is used to proxy market returns and the
standard market model is used to determine beta. Security returns are determined from
the CRSP tapes.To reduce estimation error, we require that a security must have at
least 24 monthly return observations in the 60 months prior to portfolio formation.The
security must also have at least one monthly observation in the following 12-month
regression period.
Once the portfolios are formed, we determine monthly portfolio returns as the
equally-weighted average return of all securities in the portfolio. We determine a

The Howton and Peterson (1998) sample period extends from 1977 through 1994.

Eliminating all observations with a BE/ME greater than 10 results in 19 observations being deleted from
the sample.
4 For a subset of our data we confirm our empirical results by calculating post-ranking betas using three
additional sorts. We sort with size and beta, but with the initial sort on beta and the subsequent sort on size.
We also sort with beta and BE/ME, using both a beta-first and a beta-last sort. The results are generally
robust to sorting procedures, but using the beta-first sort produces a stronger association between beta and
returns. These results, and results from the BE/ME-beta sorts, are available from the authors.

single post-ranking beta5 for each portfolio by regressing monthly returns from the
CRSP NYSE/AMEX equally-weighted index on the monthly portfolio return for the
period July 1975 though June 1994. Although each of the 100 portfolios associates
with a single beta value, security betas may change from year to year as the security
is assigned to different portfolios.
Thus, we use the Fama and French (1992) methodology to examine the relationship between monthly returns and BE/ME, firm size and beta. To compare with
HP (1998) we determine the value of the average regression coefficient with data
separated into up markets and down markets, and between January and other months
of the year. We identify up (down) markets as any month in which market excess
return (measured by the NYSE/AMEX equally-weighted index minus the one-month
T-bill)6 is positive (negative).

returns against constant-risk beta, size, and BE/ME when the market is not segmented

5 Unlike French and Fama (1992), a lagged variable is not included to estimate the post-ranking betas, since
Fant and Peterson (1995) report that employing the Scholes-Williams technique does not materially affect
the results. We check for robustness of the results by allowing post-ranking betas to shift by estimating beta
using overlapping 60 month regressions. This alternative does not produce significantly different results.

between up and down markets. Both studies find a negative and insignificant payment
for beta risk, and a significant payment for BE/ME. These results are consistent with
Fama and French (1992). We also find a significant negative relationship between
size and returns, consistent with Fama and French (1992). In contrast, HP (1998) find
an insignificant relationship between size and returns.7

4.2. Bull (up) vs. bear (down) markets
Table 2 compares regression results when markets are segmented into up and
down markets. HP (1998) divide the market into bull (up) and bear (down) market
(hereafter bull and bear markets) so that dual-market betas may be applied in appropriate market conditions.8 In contrast we regress returns against constant-risk betas.

7 We acknowledge that HP (1998) include an earnings to price ratio in their study and that the interaction
between these variables may influence the results. However, in their study Fama and French include an
earnings to price variable similar to HP (1998) and continue to find size to be highly significant.
8 HP (1998) identify bull market months (up market) as those months with a market return higher than
the median return for the total sample and bear market months (down market) as those with a market
return lower than the median market return. In contrast, we identify a bull market as one where the market
return is greater than the risk-free return and bear market as one where the market return is lower than the

130

G. Pettengill et al./The Financial Review 37 (2002) 123–136

We seek to determine if HP’s (1998) use of dual market betas is a necessary condition
to find a significant relationship between beta and returns.
Table 2, Panel A reports the results of regressions conducted in bull markets.
Both the bull-market beta (used by HP, 1998) and the constant-risk beta show a
highly significant positive relationship to returns. Thus, it appears that the market
segmentation procedure is a sufficient condition to finding a significant relationship
between beta and returns. The addition of dual-market betas is not necessary to find
a significant relation between beta and returns. Both studies find an insignificant
relationship between BE/ME and returns in bull markets. Further, in bull markets we
find a marginally significant relationship between size and returns and HP (1998)
find an insignificant relationship between size and returns.
Table 2, Panel B reports results for regressions in bear markets. As argued by
PSM (1995), a significant negative relationship exists between both bear-market betas
and returns and constant-risk betas and returns. The bear market results confirm the
findings from the bull market data that market segmentation procedures rather than
dual-market betas appear to be critical in finding a significant relationship between
beta and returns.
Both studies also find a highly significant relationship between returns and
size and between BE/ME and returns in bear markets. High BE/ME and small size
securities receive a return premium in bear markets.

4.3. Seasonality
A number of previous studies have found a seasonal component in the size effect
and the relationship between beta and returns. Hence, HP (1998) segment their data
between January and other months using dual-market betas. Table 3 contrasts the
findings of HP (1998) with the use of a constant-risk beta with markets segmented
by both bull and bear markets and months of the year.
HP (1998) find the relationship between bull- and bear-market betas to be generally robust to the division of data by month of the year. We confirm the consistent
relationship with beta and returns using constant-risk betas. The relationship between
bear market betas and returns is insignificant in January. In contrast, the relationship
between constant-risk betas and returns is significant at the 1% level in January.
Regressions with the sample divided by month of the year provide further support for
the proposition that market segmentation procedures rather than dual-market betas
are required to find a significant relationship between beta and returns.
Consistent with HP (1998), we find a significant (insignificant) relationship
between returns and BE/ME in bear markets (bull markets) regardless of the month of
the year. We also find a significant relationship between size and returns in January
regardless of whether the market is bull or bear. In other months of the year the

risk-free return. This follows PSM (1995)’s argument for a positive relation between beta and returns when
(Rm − Rf > 0) and a negative relation between beta and returns when (Rm − Rf > 0) (see page 104-105).

relationship between size and returns is significant in bear markets but insignificant
in bull markets. The basic relationships between beta and returns, size and returns,
and BE/ME and returns are unaffected by the use of dual-market betas in place of
constant risk betas.

5. Implications for risk-return relationship
5.1. Constant-risk beta and dual-market betas
Fama and French (1992) find an insignificant relationship between beta and
returns in all markets. Based on this finding they conclude that the market does not
reward the holding of systematic risk as measured by beta. PSM (1995) argue that this
finding results from the failure of empirical studies to distinguish between expected
and realized returns. They find a significant conditional relationship between realized
returns and beta with markets segmented between bull and bear markets. Further, by
comparing average returns of portfolios segmented by beta, they conclude that the
market does compensate for beta risk.
This study considers the effect of size and BE/ME on the relation between
beta and returns when markets are segmented into bull and bear markets. We find
a significant relationship between beta and realized returns even in the presence of
size and BE/ME in bull and bear markets. This supports the argument that beta risk

132

G. Pettengill et al./The Financial Review 37 (2002) 123–136

is rewarded in bull markets for losses incurred in bear markets. But in the presence of
size and BE/ME, a lack of symmetry is revealed between premium payments to beta
in bull markets and bear markets suggesting that investors may not receive adequate
compensation for systematic risk as measured by beta.
As shown in Table 2, the relationship between returns and separate bull and
bear market betas does not suffer from the same lack of symmetry that is found for
the constant risk betas. This relationship suggests that the dual-market betas provide
further insights into the risk-return relation. However, the exact nature of this insight
awaits further theoretical development, including how to compare systematic risk
across securities when different bull and bear market betas exist.

5.2. Dual-market betas and the size effect
It is important to recognize that there is an association between size and dualmarket betas. Both Wiggins (1992) and Bhardwaj and Brooks (1993) show that betas
for small firm securities are larger in bull markets than in bear markets and that betas
for large firm securities are smaller in bull markets than in bear markets. This result
suggests that the systematic risk for small-firm securities may be overstated. In other
words, the size effect is actually understated. This relationship can be illustrated with
an example.
Assume two securities, Security A and Security B, possess the same constant-risk
beta. Further, assume that these securities differ in their reaction to market fluctuations
if the market is divided between bull and bear markets. Security A has a large beta in
bull markets and a smaller beta in bear markets. Security B has a small beta in bull
markets and a large beta in bear markets. This implies that Security A appears to have
significant bull market potential with small downside risk. In contrast, Security B
appears to have limited bull market potential and greater downside risk. Given these
relations security B is clearly riskier than security A. Small-firm securities tend to
have larger bull-market betas than bear-market betas. Large-firm securities tend to
have smaller bull-market betas than bear-market betas. Thus, the use of a constant
risk beta overstates the beta risk of small-firm securities and understates the beta risk
of large-firm securities. The existence of dual-market betas magnifies the conclusion
that in the presence of size systematic risk appears to be inadequately compensated.
Since constant-risk betas overstate systematic risk for small-firm securities, the size
effect is understated.9

9 These results are notwithstanding the empirical work of Bhardwaj and Brooks (1993), who argue that
time-varying betas reverse the size effect. They regress returns against time-varying betas and find that
the small-firm portfolios have negative alphas and that the large-firm portfolios have positive alphas in
up markets. They conclude, therefore, that given compensation for varying beta risk, large firm securities
outperform small firm securities. This analysis, however, ignores the obvious. High correlation with a
market index in up markets, and low correlation with a market index in down markets, does not suggest
high risk. A high beta for small-firm securities in up markets does not suggest risk. It suggests high returns.

5.3. Size and BE/ME and risk
Fama and French find a significant relationship between size and returns and between BE/ME and returns. Given this relationship and the presumption that the market
rewards risk bearing, they argue that these two variables proxy for risk. This conclusion may be challenged on the basis that the market may be inefficient. Lakinishok,
Schleifer, and Vishny (1994) argue that payment to securities with high BE/ME
results from naive investors assuming that recent earning growth patterns will continue. One may also criticize this conclusion on the basis that the explanation of the
relationship between size and BE/ME has not been fully developed. To the extent
that a theoretical basis exists for this relationship, discussion has centered on the
possibility that payment to these variables represents payment for default risk (i.e.,
Chan and Chen, 1991; Fama and French, 1993; Daniel and Titman, 1997; Dichev,
1998).
The results reported by HP (1998) and this study argue against the possibility that
payment to size and BE/ME represents a payment for default risk. Securities with high
distress risk should exhibit their risk through relative low returns in bear markets when
market sentiment is generally pessimistic. Risk compensation should be achieved by
higher returns in bull markets when market sentiment is less concerned about default.
Empirical results are exactly opposite of this expectation. Premium payment to both
high BE/ME and small size securities occurs mostly in bear markets. Although Fama
and French (1996) argue that individual securities and individual industries may
experience distress in bull markets, one would expect to see a tendency for distress
in bear markets for the aggregate sample. Certainly one would not expect securities
with high distress risk to experience significantly higher returns than other securities
in bear markets.
In addition, compensation for risk should not vary with the time of the year.
Empirical results, reported in Table 3, indicate that the relationship between beta
and returns is consistent over months of the year. However, in the presence of either
constant-risk or dual-market betas the relationship, especially between size and returns, varies with season of the year. In bull markets the relationship between size and
returns is highly significant in January but insignificant in other months of the year.
In bear markets the relationship between size and returns is significant throughout
the year but much stronger in January than in other months. The concentration of the
premium payment to size in the month of January argues against the presumption that
the premium payment found for small-firm securities reflects risk payment, unless
this risk factor varies with the month of the year.10

10 In results not reported here, we also find that the relationship between constant-risk beta and returns are
consistent across time periods, but that the relationship between size and returns and especially between
BE/ME and returns varies across time. In fact, in up markets the payment to high BE/ME securities is
significantly positive in one period and significantly negative in another period.

6. Conclusion
Empirical studies have shown that betas vary systematically in bull and bear
markets. HP (1998) argue that consideration of these dual-market betas results in a
significant relationship between betas and returns. We have shown, however, that the
use of market segmentation procedures as advocated by PSM (1995) is a sufficient
condition to find a significant relationship between beta and returns. This result
provides support for the existence of a payment for systematic risk and the use of
constant risk betas. However, in the presence of size and BE/ME, when all markets
are considered, payment to beta risk appears to be inadequate.
Further, we find that using market segmentation procedures, size and the ratio
of book value to market value (BE/ME) do not appear to proxy for risk. The variation
in the relationship between returns and size and returns and BE/ME in bull and bear
markets disputes the argument that size receives a premium payment for default
risk.
Further research is necessary to help explain why beta does not appear to receive
adequate payment for risk when size and BE/ME are considered. An examination of
premium payments to size and BE/ME, primarily found in bear markets, is needed
to determine if these payments result from (a) market imperfection as argued by
Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1994), (b) the influence of outliers as found by Knez
and Ready (1997), or (c) survivorship bias as studied by Davis (1994). In addition,
the role of dual-market betas as discussed by HP (1998) needs to be explored more
fully. Is the variation in bull and bear market betas for individual securities consistent
across time? If so, how does one measure systematic risk for these securities? Further
research also needs to determine if the relationship between size and beta as shown
by Wiggins (1992) is consistent and how this relationship affects the definition of
systematic risk for individual securities.
